-- Lists the root or organizational units (OUs) that serve as the immediate parent of the specified child OU or account. This operation, along with 'ListChildren' enables you to traverse the tree structure that makes up this root.

-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | Creates a value of 'ListParents' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lNextToken' - Use this parameter if you receive a @NextToken@ response in a previous request that indicates that there is more output available. Set it to the value of the previous call's @NextToken@ response to indicate where the output should continue from.
--
-- * 'lMaxResults' - (Optional) Use this to limit the number of results you want included in the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the @NextToken@ response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the @NextToken@ request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check @NextToken@ after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
--
-- * 'lChildId' - The unique identifier (ID) of the OU or account whose parent containers you want to list. Do not specify a root. The <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex regex pattern> for a child ID string requires one of the following:     * Account: a string that consists of exactly 12 digits.     * Organizational unit (OU): a string that begins with "ou-" followed by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU) followed by a second "-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lower-case letters or digits.
