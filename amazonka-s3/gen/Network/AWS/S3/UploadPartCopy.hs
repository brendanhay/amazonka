--
-- Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.
-- You specify the data source by adding the request header
-- @x-amz-copy-source@ in your request and a byte range by adding the
-- request header @x-amz-copy-source-range@ in your request.
--
-- The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more
-- information about multipart upload limits, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html Quick Facts>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html UploadPart>
-- operation and provide data in your request.
--
-- You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In
-- response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique
-- identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part
-- request.
--
-- For more information about using the @UploadPartCopy@ operation, see the
-- following:
--
-- -   For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload>
--     in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- -   For information about permissions required to use the multipart
--     upload API, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html Multipart Upload API and Permissions>
--     in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- -   For information about copying objects using a single atomic
--     operation vs. the multipart upload, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html Operations on Objects>
--     in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- -   For information about using server-side encryption with
--     customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation,
--     see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html CopyObject>
--     and
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html UploadPart>.
--
-- Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@, @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@,
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@, and
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@:
--
-- -   __Consideration 1__ - If both of the @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@
--     and @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ headers are present in
--     the request as follows:
--
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ condition evaluates to @true@, and;
--
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ condition evaluates to
--     @false@;
--
--     Amazon S3 returns @200 OK@ and copies the data.
--
-- -   __Consideration 2__ - If both of the
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ and
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ headers are present in the
--     request as follows:
--
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ condition evaluates to @false@,
--     and;
--
--     @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ condition evaluates to @true@;
--
--     Amazon S3 returns @412 Precondition Failed@ response code.
--
-- __Versioning__
--
-- If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions
-- of the same object. By default, @x-amz-copy-source@ identifies the
-- current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a
-- delete marker and you don\'t specify a versionId in the
-- @x-amz-copy-source@, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object
-- does not exist. If you specify versionId in the @x-amz-copy-source@ and
-- the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error,
-- because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for
-- the @x-amz-copy-source@.
--
-- You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to
-- copy by adding the @versionId@ subresource as shown in the following
-- example:
--
-- @x-amz-copy-source: \/bucket\/object?versionId=version id@
--
-- __Special Errors__
--
-- -   -   /Code: NoSuchUpload/
--
--     -   /Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
--         upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
--         been aborted or completed./
--
--     -   /HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found/
--
-- -   -   /Code: InvalidRequest/
--
--     -   /Cause: The specified copy source is not supported as a
--         byte-range copy source./
--
--     -   /HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request/

--
-- -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name

--     point, in the format
--     @arn:aws:s3:\<Region>:\<account-id>:accesspoint\/\<access-point-name>\/object\/\<key>@.

--
--     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the

--
-- 'key', 'uploadPartCopy_key' - Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

--
-- -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name
--     of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a
--     slash (\/). For example, to copy the object @reports\/january.pdf@
--     from the bucket @awsexamplebucket@, use
--     @awsexamplebucket\/reports\/january.pdf@. The value must be URL
--     encoded.
--
-- -   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon
--     Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access
--     point, in the format
--     @arn:aws:s3:\<Region>:\<account-id>:accesspoint\/\<access-point-name>\/object\/\<key>@.
--     For example, to copy the object @reports\/january.pdf@ through
--     access point @my-access-point@ owned by account @123456789012@ in
--     Region @us-west-2@, use the URL encoding of
--     @arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint\/my-access-point\/object\/reports\/january.pdf@.
--     The value must be URL encoded.
--
--     Amazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the
--     source and destination buckets are in the same AWS Region.
--
--     Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts,
--     specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format
--     @arn:aws:s3-outposts:\<Region>:\<account-id>:outpost\/\<outpost-id>\/object\/\<key>@.
--     For example, to copy the object @reports\/january.pdf@ through
--     outpost @my-outpost@ owned by account @123456789012@ in Region
--     @us-west-2@, use the URL encoding of
--     @arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost\/my-outpost\/object\/reports\/january.pdf@.
--     The value must be URL encoded.
--
-- To copy a specific version of an object, append
-- @?versionId=\<version-id>@ to the value (for example,
-- @awsexamplebucket\/reports\/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893@).
-- If you don\'t specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version
-- of the source object.
