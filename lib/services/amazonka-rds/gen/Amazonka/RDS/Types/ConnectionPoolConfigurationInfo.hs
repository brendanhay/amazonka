--
-- 'connectionBorrowTimeout', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_connectionBorrowTimeout' - The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become

-- its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with
-- client sessions.
--
-- 'initQuery', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_initQuery' - One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new
-- database connection. Typically used with @SET@ statements to make sure
-- that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and
-- character set. This setting is empty by default. For multiple
-- statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include
-- multiple variables in a single @SET@ statement, such as @SET x=1, y=2@.
--
-- 'maxConnectionsPercent', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_maxConnectionsPercent' - The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target
-- group. The value is expressed as a percentage of the @max_connections@
-- setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target
-- group.
--
-- 'maxIdleConnectionsPercent', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_maxIdleConnectionsPercent' - Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the
-- connection pool. The value is expressed as a percentage of the
-- @max_connections@ setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster

-- percentage of idle database connections open. A low value causes the
-- proxy to close more idle connections and return them to the database.
--
-- 'sessionPinningFilters', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_sessionPinningFilters' - Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally
-- cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to
