-- Deletes all versions of the bot, including the @$LATEST@ version. To
-- delete a specific version of the bot, use the DeleteBotVersion
-- operation. The @DeleteBot@ operation doesn\'t immediately remove the bot
-- schema. Instead, it is marked for deletion and removed later.
--
-- Amazon Lex stores utterances indefinitely for improving the ability of
-- your bot to respond to user inputs. These utterances are not removed
-- when the bot is deleted. To remove the utterances, use the
-- DeleteUtterances operation.
--
-- If a bot has an alias, you can\'t delete it. Instead, the @DeleteBot@
-- operation returns a @ResourceInUseException@ exception that includes a
-- reference to the alias that refers to the bot. To remove the reference
-- to the bot, delete the alias. If you get the same exception again,
-- delete the referring alias until the @DeleteBot@ operation is
-- successful.
--
-- This operation requires permissions for the @lex:DeleteBot@ action.
