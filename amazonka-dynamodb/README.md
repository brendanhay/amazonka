## Description

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast
and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon
DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of
data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically
spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of
servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the
amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-dynamodb)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
