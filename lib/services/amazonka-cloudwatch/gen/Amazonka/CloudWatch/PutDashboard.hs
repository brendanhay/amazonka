-- Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing
-- dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced
-- with what you specify here.
--
-- All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.
--
-- A simple way to create a dashboard using @PutDashboard@ is to copy an
-- existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you
-- can load the dashboard and then use the View\/edit source command in the
-- Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way
-- to copy a dashboard is to use @GetDashboard@, and then use the data
-- returned within @DashboardBody@ as the template for the new dashboard
-- when you call @PutDashboard@.
--
-- When you create a dashboard with @PutDashboard@, a good practice is to
-- add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the
-- dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the
-- console. This message could also point console users to the location of
-- the @DashboardBody@ script or the CloudFormation template used to create
-- the dashboard.
