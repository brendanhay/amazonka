--
-- Writes multiple data records into an Amazon Kinesis stream in a single call (also referred to as a @PutRecords@ request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing.
--
--
-- Each @PutRecords@ request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MB, up to a limit of 5 MB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.
--
-- You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request @Records@ , with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.
--
-- The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.
--
-- The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream Adding Data to a Stream> in the /Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide/ .
--
-- Each record in the @Records@ array may include an optional parameter, @ExplicitHashKey@ , which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords> in the /Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide/ .
--
-- The @PutRecords@ response includes an array of response @Records@ . Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response @Records@ array always includes the same number of records as the request array.
--
-- The response @Records@ array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Amazon Kinesis attempts to process all records in each @PutRecords@ request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.
--
-- A successfully-processed record includes @ShardId@ and @SequenceNumber@ values. The @ShardId@ parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The @SequenceNumber@ parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.
--
-- An unsuccessfully-processed record includes @ErrorCode@ and @ErrorMessage@ values. @ErrorCode@ reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: @ProvisionedThroughputExceededException@ or @InternalFailure@ . @ErrorMessage@ provides more detailed information about the @ProvisionedThroughputExceededException@ exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords> in the /Amazon Kinesis Streams Developer Guide/ .
--
-- By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use 'IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod' or 'DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod' to modify this retention period.
