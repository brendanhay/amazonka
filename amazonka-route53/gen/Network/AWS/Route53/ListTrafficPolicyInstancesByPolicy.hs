-- Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created by using a specify traffic policy version.

-- Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use the @MaxItems@ parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.

-- | Creates a value of 'ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ltpibpTrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker' - If the value of @IsTruncated@ in the previous response was @true@ , you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another @ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy@ request. For the value of @trafficpolicyinstancetype@ , specify the value of @TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker@ from the previous response, which is the name of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request. If the value of @IsTruncated@ in the previous response was @false@ , there are no more traffic policy instances to get.
--
-- * 'ltpibpMaxItems' - The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the response body for this request. If you have more than @MaxItems@ traffic policy instances, the value of the @IsTruncated@ element in the response is @true@ , and the values of @HostedZoneIdMarker@ , @TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker@ , and @TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker@ represent the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request.
--
-- * 'ltpibpHostedZoneIdMarker' - If the value of @IsTruncated@ in the previous response was @true@ , you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another @ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy@ request.  For the value of @hostedzoneid@ , specify the value of @HostedZoneIdMarker@ from the previous response, which is the hosted zone ID of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return if you submit another request. If the value of @IsTruncated@ in the previous response was @false@ , there are no more traffic policy instances to get.
--
-- * 'ltpibpTrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker' - If the value of @IsTruncated@ in the previous response was @true@ , you have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy instances, submit another @ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy@ request.
