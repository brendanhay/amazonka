    -- [price-capacity-optimized (recommended)]
    --     EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity
    --     availability for the number of instances that are launching. This
    --     means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we
    --     believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. EC2
    --     Fleet then requests Spot Instances from the lowest priced of these
    --     pools.

    -- [capacity-optimized]
    --     EC2 Fleet identifies the pools with the highest capacity
    --     availability for the number of instances that are launching. This
    --     means that we will request Spot Instances from the pools that we
    --     believe have the lowest chance of interruption in the near term. To
    --     give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use
    --     @capacity-optimized-prioritized@. Set a priority for each instance
    --     type by using the @Priority@ parameter for
    --     @LaunchTemplateOverrides@. You can assign the same priority to
    --     different @LaunchTemplateOverrides@. EC2 implements the priorities
    --     on a best-effort basis, but optimizes for capacity first.
    --     @capacity-optimized-prioritized@ is supported only if your EC2 Fleet
    --     uses a launch template. Note that if the On-Demand
    --     @AllocationStrategy@ is set to @prioritized@, the same priority is
    --     applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity.

    --     EC2 Fleet requests instances from all of the Spot Instance pools

    --
    -- [lowest-price]
    --     EC2 Fleet requests instances from the lowest priced Spot Instance
    --     pool that has available capacity. If the lowest priced pool doesn\'t
    --     have available capacity, the Spot Instances come from the next
    --     lowest priced pool that has available capacity. If a pool runs out
    --     of capacity before fulfilling your desired capacity, EC2 Fleet will
    --     continue to fulfill your request by drawing from the next lowest
    --     priced pool. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might
    --     receive Spot Instances from several pools. Because this strategy
    --     only considers instance price and not capacity availability, it
    --     might lead to high interruption rates.
