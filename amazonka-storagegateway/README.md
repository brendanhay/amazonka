## Description

AWS Storage Gateway Service

AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
integration between an organization\'s on-premises IT environment and
AWS\'s storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely
upload data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid
disaster recovery.

Use the following links to get started using the /AWS Storage Gateway
Service API Reference/:

-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers>:
    Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST
    request to AWS Storage Gateway.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html Signing Requests>:
    AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you
    send; this topic describes how sign such a request.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/APIErrorResponses.html Error Responses>:
    Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html Operations in AWS Storage Gateway>:
    Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway
    operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible
    errors, and examples of requests and responses.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints>:
    Provides a list of each of the regions and endpoints available for
    use with AWS Storage Gateway.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-storagegateway)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
