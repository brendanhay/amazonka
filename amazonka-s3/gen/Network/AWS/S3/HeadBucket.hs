-- This operation is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have
-- permission to access it. The operation returns a @200 OK@ if the bucket
-- exists and you have permission to access it.
--
-- If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it,
-- the @HEAD@ request returns a generic @404 Not Found@ or @403 Forbidden@
-- code. A message body is not included, so you cannot determine the
-- exception beyond these error codes.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
-- @s3:ListBucket@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default
-- and can grant this permission to others. For more information about
-- permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations>
