-- | Only use this setting when you change the default value, Auto (AUTO),
-- for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all defaults,
-- excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and all other adaptive quantization
-- from your JSON job specification, MediaConvert automatically applies the
-- best types of quantization for your video content. When you set
-- H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other than AUTO, the default value
-- for H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this
-- default value to adjust quantization within each frame based on spatial
-- variation of content complexity. When you enable this feature, the
-- encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with
-- no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any
-- small distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured
-- blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are
-- encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will almost always improve
-- your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\'t take into
-- account where the viewer\'s attention is likely to be. If viewers are
-- likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen with a lot
-- of complex texture, you might choose to set
-- H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting:
-- When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the value for
-- Adaptive quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) depending on your
-- content. For homogeneous content, such as cartoons and video games, set
-- it to Low. For content with a wider variety of textures, set it to High
-- or Higher. To manually enable or disable
-- H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quantization
-- (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value other than AUTO.
