-- Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3
-- removes all the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle
-- subresource associated with the bucket. Your objects never expire, and
-- Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of
-- rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
-- @s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration@ action. By default, the bucket owner has
-- this permission and the bucket owner can grant this permission to
-- others.
--
-- There is usually some time lag before lifecycle configuration deletion
-- is fully propagated to all the Amazon S3 systems.
--
-- For more information about the object expiration, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#intro-lifecycle-rules-actions Elements to Describe Lifecycle Actions>.
