--
-- Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation
-- creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key
-- in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can
-- create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a
-- different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the
-- CreateKey operation.
--
-- This operation supports /multi-Region keys/, an KMS feature that lets
-- you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web
-- Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key
-- material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to
-- encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a
-- different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or
-- making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region
-- keys, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html Multi-Region keys in KMS>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- A /replica key/ is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used
-- independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and
-- its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They
-- have the same
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id key ID>
-- and key material. They also have the same
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec key spec>,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage key usage>,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin key material origin>,
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html automatic key rotation status>.
-- KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related
-- multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ,
-- including its
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html key policy>,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html tags>,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html aliases>,
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html Key states of KMS keys>.
-- KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and
-- replica key.
--
-- When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key
-- state of @Creating@. This key state changes to @Enabled@ (or
-- @PendingImport@) after a few seconds when the process of creating the
-- new replica key is complete. While the key state is @Creating@, you can
-- manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If
-- you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on
-- @KMSInvalidStateException@ or call @DescribeKey@ to check its @KeyState@
-- value before using it. For details about the @Creating@ key state, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html Key states of KMS keys>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- You cannot create more than one replica of a primary key in any Region.
-- If the Region already includes a replica of the key you\'re trying to
-- replicate, @ReplicateKey@ returns an @AlreadyExistsException@ error. If
-- the key state of the existing replica is @PendingDeletion@, you can
-- cancel the scheduled key deletion (CancelKeyDeletion) or wait for the
-- key to be deleted. The new replica key you create will have the same
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html#mrk-sync-properties shared properties>
-- as the original replica key.
--
-- The CloudTrail log of a @ReplicateKey@ operation records a
-- @ReplicateKey@ operation in the primary key\'s Region and a CreateKey
-- operation in the replica key\'s Region.
--
-- If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material,
-- the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the
-- same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details,
-- see
-- <kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html Importing key material into multi-Region keys>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion
-- operation.
--
-- @ReplicateKey@ uses different default values for the @KeyPolicy@ and
-- @Tags@ parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see
-- the parameter descriptions.
--
-- __Cross-account use__: No. You cannot use this operation to create a
-- replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
--
-- __Required permissions__:
--
-- -   @kms:ReplicateKey@ on the primary key (in the primary key\'s
--     Region). Include this permission in the primary key\'s key policy.
--
-- -   @kms:CreateKey@ in an IAM policy in the replica Region.
--
-- -   To use the @Tags@ parameter, @kms:TagResource@ in an IAM policy in
--     the replica Region.

-- | Assigns one or more tags to the replica key. Use this parameter to tag
-- the KMS key when it is created. To tag an existing KMS key, use the
-- TagResource operation.
--
-- Do not include confidential or sensitive information in this field. This
-- field may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail logs and other output.
--
-- Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission to the KMS
-- key. For details, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html ABAC for KMS>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- To use this parameter, you must have
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html kms:TagResource>
-- permission in an IAM policy.
--
-- Tags are not a shared property of multi-Region keys. You can specify the
-- same tags or different tags for each key in a set of related
-- multi-Region keys. KMS does not synchronize this property.
--
-- Each tag consists of a tag key and a tag value. Both the tag key and the
-- tag value are required, but the tag value can be an empty (null) string.
-- You cannot have more than one tag on a KMS key with the same tag key. If
-- you specify an existing tag key with a different tag value, KMS replaces
-- the current tag value with the specified one.
--
-- When you add tags to an Amazon Web Services resource, Amazon Web
-- Services generates a cost allocation report with usage and costs
-- aggregated by tags. Tags can also be used to control access to a KMS
-- key. For details, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html Tagging Keys>.

-- | Identifies the multi-Region primary key that is being replicated. To

--
-- Specify the key ID or key ARN of a multi-Region primary key.
--
-- For example:
--
-- -   Key ID: @mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab@

-- of Amazon Web Services Regions in which KMS is supported, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region KMS service endpoints>
-- in the /Amazon Web Services General Reference/.
--
-- HMAC KMS keys are not supported in all Amazon Web Services Regions. If
-- you try to replicate an HMAC KMS key in an Amazon Web Services Region in
-- which HMAC keys are not supported, the @ReplicateKey@ operation returns
-- an @UnsupportedOperationException@. For a list of Regions in which HMAC
-- KMS keys are supported, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/hmac.html HMAC keys in KMS>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- The replica must be in a different Amazon Web Services Region than its
-- primary key and other replicas of that primary key, but in the same
-- Amazon Web Services partition. KMS must be available in the replica
-- Region. If the Region is not enabled by default, the Amazon Web Services
-- account must be enabled in the Region. For information about Amazon Web
-- Services partitions, see
