-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'phrCurrencyCode' - The currency in which the @totalUpfrontPrice@ , @LimitPrice@ , and @totalHourlyPrice@ amounts are specified. At this time, the only supported currency is @USD@ .
--
-- * 'phrClientToken' - Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html How to Ensure Idempotency> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'phrLimitPrice' - The specified limit is checked against the total upfront cost of the reservation (calculated as the offering's upfront cost multiplied by the host count). If the total upfront cost is greater than the specified price limit, the request will fail. This is used to ensure that the purchase does not exceed the expected upfront cost of the purchase. At this time, the only supported currency is @USD@ . For example, to indicate a limit price of USD 100, specify 100.00.
--
-- * 'phrHostIdSet' - The ID/s of the Dedicated Host/s that the reservation will be associated with.
--
-- * 'phrOfferingId' - The ID of the offering.
