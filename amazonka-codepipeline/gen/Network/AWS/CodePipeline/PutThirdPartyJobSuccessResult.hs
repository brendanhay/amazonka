-- | Creates a value of 'PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ptpjsrContinuationToken' - A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deployment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a partner action in progress. Future jobs will use this token in order to identify the running instance of the action. It can be reused to return additional information about the progress of the partner action. When the action is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.
--
-- * 'ptpjsrExecutionDetails' - The details of the actions taken and results produced on an artifact as it passes through stages in the pipeline.
--
-- * 'ptpjsrCurrentRevision' - Represents information about a current revision.
--
-- * 'ptpjsrJobId' - The ID of the job that successfully completed. This is the same ID returned from PollForThirdPartyJobs.
--
-- * 'ptpjsrClientToken' - The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its details.
