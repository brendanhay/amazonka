-- Task runners call 'PollForTask' to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a value for the 'workerGroup' parameter. The task returned can come from any of the pipelines that match the 'workerGroup' value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.
--
-- If tasks are ready in the work queue, 'PollForTask' returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, 'PollForTask' uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds, during which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call 'PollForTask' again on the same 'workerGroup' until it receives a response, and this can take up to 90 seconds.

-- | Identity information for the EC2 instance that is hosting the task runner. You can get this value from the instance using 'http:\/\/169.254.169.254\/latest\/meta-data\/instance-id'. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html Instance Metadata> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide./ Passing in this value proves that your task runner is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures the proper AWS Data Pipeline service charges are applied to your pipeline.
