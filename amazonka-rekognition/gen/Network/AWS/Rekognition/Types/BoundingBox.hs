-- | Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text or personal
-- protective equipment. The @left@ (x-coordinate) and @top@ (y-coordinate)
-- are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the bounding box.
-- Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).
--
-- The @top@ and @left@ values returned are ratios of the overall image
-- size. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the
-- top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API
-- returns a @left@ value of 0.5 (350\/700) and a @top@ value of 0.25
-- (50\/200).
--
-- The @width@ and @height@ values represent the dimensions of the bounding
-- box as a ratio of the overall image dimension. For example, if the input
-- image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels, the
-- width returned is 0.1.
--
-- The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if
-- Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face that is at the image edge
-- and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that
-- are outside the image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might
-- get negative values or values greater than 1 for the @left@ or @top@
-- values.
