    -- __Fleet state transition events:__
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet resource was successfully created with a
    --     status of @NEW@. Event messaging includes the fleet ID.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from @NEW@ to
    --     @DOWNLOADING@. The compressed build has started downloading to a
    --     fleet instance for installation.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from @DOWNLOADING@ to
    --     @VALIDATING@. Amazon GameLift has successfully downloaded the build
    --     and is now validating the build files.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from @VALIDATING@ to
    --     @BUILDING@. Amazon GameLift has successfully verified the build
    --     files and is now running the installation scripts.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from @BUILDING@ to
    --     @ACTIVATING@. Amazon GameLift is trying to launch an instance and
    --     test the connectivity between the build and the Amazon GameLift
    --     Service via the Server SDK.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet\'s status changed from @ACTIVATING@
    --     to @ACTIVE@. The fleet is now ready to host game sessions.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_ERROR -- The Fleet\'s status changed to @ERROR@.
    --     Describe the fleet event message for more details.
    --
    -- __Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet creation activity):__
    --
    -- -   FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the
    --     fleet instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD -- The game server build was
    --     successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now
    --     being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance.
    --     Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status.
    --     Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted
    --     and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in
    --     /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER -- The game server build files were
    --     successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the build\'s
    --     install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents
    --     a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the
    --     installation steps and whether or not the install completed
    --     successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was
    --     successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server
    --     launch paths, which are specified in the fleet\'s runtime
    --     configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
    --     GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the
    --     process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from
    --     moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths
    --     in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found.
    --     Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime
    --     configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch
    --     path does not exist on the instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the
    --     runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a
    --     launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT -- Validation of the fleet at the end of
    --     creation timed out. Try fleet creation again.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED -- The fleet failed to successfully complete
    --     one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code
    --     indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet
    --     instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server
    --     process. For more information, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html#fleets-creating-debug-creation Debug Fleet Creation Issues>.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED_NO_INSTANCES -- Fleet creation was not able
    --     to obtain any instances based on the input fleet attributes. Try
    --     again at a different time or choose a different combination of fleet
    --     attributes such as fleet type, instance type, etc.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_INITIALIZATION_FAILED -- A generic exception occurred during
    --     fleet creation. Describe the fleet event message for more details.
    --
    -- __VPC peering events:__
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED -- A VPC peering connection has been
    --     established between the VPC for an Amazon GameLift fleet and a VPC
    --     in your Amazon Web Services account.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has
    --     failed. Event details and status information provide additional
    --     detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs
    --     have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this,
    --     change the CIDR block for the VPC in your Amazon Web Services
    --     account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html>
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED -- A VPC peering connection has been
    --     successfully deleted.
    --
    -- __Spot instance events:__
    --
    -- -   INSTANCE_INTERRUPTED -- A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with
    --     a two-minute notification.
    --
    -- __Server process events:__
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_INVALID_PATH -- The game server executable or script
    --     could not be found based on the Fleet runtime configuration. Check
    --     that the launch path is correct based on the operating system of the
    --     Fleet.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_SDK_INITIALIZATION_TIMEOUT -- The server process did
    --     not call InitSDK() within the time expected. Check your game session
    --     log to see why InitSDK() was not called in time.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_READY_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not
    --     call ProcessReady() within the time expected after calling
    --     InitSDK(). Check your game session log to see why ProcessReady() was
    --     not called in time.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_CRASHED -- The server process exited without calling
    --     ProcessEnding(). Check your game session log to see why
    --     ProcessEnding() was not called.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_TERMINATED_UNHEALTHY -- The server process did not
    --     report a valid health check for too long and was therefore
    --     terminated by GameLift. Check your game session log to see if the
    --     thread became stuck processing a synchronous task for too long.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_FORCE_TERMINATED -- The server process did not exit
    --     cleanly after OnProcessTerminate() was sent within the time
    --     expected. Check your game session log to see why termination took
    --     longer than expected.
    --
    -- -   SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_EXIT_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not
    --     exit cleanly within the time expected after calling ProcessEnding().
    --     Check your game session log to see why termination took longer than
    --     expected.
    --
    -- __Game session events:__
    --
    -- -   GAME_SESSION_ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT -- GameSession failed to activate
    --     within the expected time. Check your game session log to see why
    --     ActivateGameSession() took longer to complete than expected.
    --
    -- __Other fleet events:__
    --
    -- -   FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet\'s capacity
    --     settings (desired instances, minimum\/maximum scaling limits). Event
    --     messaging includes the new capacity settings.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was
    --     made to the fleet\'s game session protection policy setting. Event
    --     messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.

--     not call InitSDK() within the time expected. Check your game session
--     log to see why InitSDK() was not called in time.
--
-- -   SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_READY_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not
--     call ProcessReady() within the time expected after calling
--     InitSDK(). Check your game session log to see why ProcessReady() was
--     not called in time.
--
-- -   SERVER_PROCESS_CRASHED -- The server process exited without calling
--     ProcessEnding(). Check your game session log to see why
--     ProcessEnding() was not called.
--
-- -   SERVER_PROCESS_TERMINATED_UNHEALTHY -- The server process did not
--     report a valid health check for too long and was therefore
--     terminated by GameLift. Check your game session log to see if the
--     thread became stuck processing a synchronous task for too long.
--
-- -   SERVER_PROCESS_FORCE_TERMINATED -- The server process did not exit
--     cleanly after OnProcessTerminate() was sent within the time

--     longer than expected.
--
-- -   SERVER_PROCESS_PROCESS_EXIT_TIMEOUT -- The server process did not
--     exit cleanly within the time expected after calling ProcessEnding().
--     Check your game session log to see why termination took longer than

-- __Game session events:__
--
-- -   GAME_SESSION_ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT -- GameSession failed to activate
--     within the expected time. Check your game session log to see why
--     ActivateGameSession() took longer to complete than expected.
--
-- __Other fleet events:__
--
-- -   FLEET_SCALING_EVENT -- A change was made to the fleet\'s capacity
--     settings (desired instances, minimum\/maximum scaling limits). Event
--     messaging includes the new capacity settings.
--
-- -   FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was
--     made to the fleet\'s game session protection policy setting. Event
--     messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.
--
-- -   FLEET_DELETED -- A request to delete a fleet was initiated.
--
-- -   GENERIC_EVENT -- An unspecified event has occurred.
