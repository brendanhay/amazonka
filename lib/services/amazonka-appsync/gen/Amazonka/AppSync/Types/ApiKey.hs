-- | Describes an API key.
--
-- Customers invoke AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an
-- identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
--
-- __da1__: We introduced this version at launch in November 2017. These
-- keys always expire after 7 days. Amazon DynamoDB TTL manages key
-- expiration. These keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018, and
-- they should no longer be used.
--
-- -   @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
-- -   @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
-- -   @UpdateApiKey@ is not available for this key version.
--
-- -   @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
-- -   Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a
--     bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB
--     expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we
--     deleted these keys from the table on February 21, 2018.
--
-- __da2__: We introduced this version in February 2018 when AppSync added
-- support to extend key expiration.
--
-- -   @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in
--     seconds.
--
-- -   @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in
--     seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.
--
-- -   @UpdateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and and deletion time in
--     seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.
--     Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the expiration time. You
--     can update the key expiration time as long as the key isn\'t
--     deleted.
--
-- -   @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
-- -   Expiration is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. After the expiration
--     time, using the key to authenticate will fail. However, you can
--     reinstate the key before deletion.
--
-- -   Deletion is stored in DynamoDB as seconds. The key is deleted after
--     deletion time.
