## Description

Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) is a web service that makes it
easy to process large amounts of data efficiently. Amazon EMR uses
Hadoop processing combined with several AWS products to do tasks such as
web indexing, data mining, log file analysis, machine learning,
scientific simulation, and data warehousing.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-emr)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/API/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
