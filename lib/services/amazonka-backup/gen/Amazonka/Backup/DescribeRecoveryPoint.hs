-- You can also increase your backup plan window using the Console by
-- choosing and editing your backup plan.

-- retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to
-- delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/gs-cleanup-resources.html#cleanup-backups Step 3: Delete the recovery points>
-- in the /Clean up resources/ section of /Getting started/.
--
-- @STOPPED@ status occurs on a continuous backup where a user has taken
-- some action that causes the continuous backup to be disabled. This can
-- be caused by the removal of permissions, turning off versioning, turning
-- off events being sent to EventBridge, or disabling the EventBridge rules
-- that are put in place by Backup.
--
-- To resolve @STOPPED@ status, ensure that all requested permissions are
-- in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these
-- conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will
-- result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recovery
-- points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.
--
-- For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 @STOPPED@ status occurs due to user action,
-- application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that future
-- continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status and check
-- SAP HANA for details.
