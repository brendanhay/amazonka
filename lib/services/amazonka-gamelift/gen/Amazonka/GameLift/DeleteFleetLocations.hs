-- Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location,
-- all game server process and all instances that are still active in the
-- location are shut down.
--
-- To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of
-- the locations to be deleted.
--
-- If successful, GameLift sets the location status to @DELETING@, and
-- begins to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in
-- each location being deleted. When completed, the location status changes
-- to @TERMINATED@.
