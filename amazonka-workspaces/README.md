## Description

Amazon WorkSpaces Service

This is the /Amazon WorkSpaces API Reference/. This guide provides
detailed information about Amazon WorkSpaces operations, data types,
parameters, and errors.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-workspaces)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/devguide/welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

> _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen` for more information.
