-- Returns a list of entities that have been affected by the specified
-- events, based on the specified filter criteria. Entities can refer to
-- individual customer resources, groups of customer resources, or any
-- other construct, depending on the AWS service. Events that have impact
-- beyond that of the affected entities, or where the extent of impact is
-- unknown, include at least one entity indicating this.
--
-- At least one event ARN is required. Results are sorted by the
-- @lastUpdatedTime@ of the entity, starting with the most recent.
--
-- -   This API operation uses pagination. Specify the @nextToken@
--     parameter in the next request to return more results.
--
-- -   This operation supports resource-level permissions. You can use this
--     operation to allow or deny access to specific AWS Health events. For
--     more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#resource-action-based-conditions Resource- and action-based conditions>
--     in the /AWS Health User Guide/.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
