--
-- Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
-- key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user.
-- A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
-- credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate
-- network. You must call the @GetFederationToken@ operation using the
-- long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is
-- appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored,
-- usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of
-- @GetFederationToken@ with the other API operations that produce
-- temporary credentials, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html Requesting Temporary Security Credentials>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison Comparing the AWS STS API operations>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate
-- users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook,
-- Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case,
-- we recommend that you use
-- <http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ Amazon Cognito> or
-- @AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity@. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You can also call @GetFederationToken@ using the security credentials of
-- an AWS account root user, but we do not recommend it. Instead, we
-- recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy
-- application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated
-- users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html IAM Best Practices>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Session duration__
--
-- The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900
-- seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The
-- default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary
-- credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials
-- have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).
--
-- __Permissions__
--
-- You can use the temporary credentials created by @GetFederationToken@ in
-- any AWS service except the following:
--
-- -   You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API.
--
-- -   You cannot call any STS operations except @GetCallerIdentity@.
--
-- You must pass an inline or managed
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session session policy>
-- to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
-- an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
-- to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
-- inline and managed session policies can\'t exceed 2,048 characters.
--
-- Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a
-- policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions.
-- When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the
-- intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you
-- pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a
-- federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more
-- permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the
-- IAM user. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session Session Policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/. For information about using
-- @GetFederationToken@ to create temporary security credentials, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getfederationtoken GetFederationToken—Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker>.
--
-- You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a
-- resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the
-- federated user session in the @Principal@ element of the policy, the
-- session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are
-- granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.
--
-- __Tags__
--
-- (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are
-- called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html Passing Session Tags in STS>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
-- session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
-- allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This
-- means that you cannot have separate @Department@ and @department@ tag
-- keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the
-- @Department@=@Marketing@ tag and you pass the @department@=@engineering@
-- session tag. @Department@ and @department@ are not saved as separate
-- tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over
-- the user tag.
