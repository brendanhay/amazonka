-- * 'dpDeleteStack' - Whether to send a delete request for the primary stack in AWS CloudFormation originally used to generate the project and its resources.

-- * 'dpClientRequestToken' - A user- or system-generated token that identifies the entity that requested project deletion. This token can be used to repeat the request.
