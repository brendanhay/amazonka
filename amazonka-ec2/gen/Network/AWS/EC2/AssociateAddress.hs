--
-- Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances
-- that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network
-- interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate
-- it to your account.
--
-- An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or
-- in a VPC. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html Elastic IP Addresses>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/.
--
-- [EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address
-- is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated
-- from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you
-- associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing
-- Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the
-- instance, but remains allocated to your account.
--
-- [VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don\'t specify a private IP
-- address, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP
-- address. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a
-- different instance or a network interface, you get an error unless you
-- allow reassociation. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an
-- instance or network interface that has an existing Elastic IP address.
--
-- [Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the
-- telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface.
--
-- You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a
-- different network border group.
--
-- This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than
-- once, Amazon EC2 doesn\'t return an error, and you may be charged for
-- each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For
-- more information, see the /Elastic IP Addresses/ section of
-- <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ Amazon EC2 Pricing>.
