-- | This object determines the values that CloudFront includes in the cache
-- key. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query
-- strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache
-- that it can return to the viewer.
--
-- The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache
-- key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the
-- origin. CloudFront sends a request when it can’t find an object in its
-- cache that matches the request’s cache key. If you want to send values
-- to the origin but /not/ include them in the cache key, use
-- @OriginRequestPolicy@.

    -- This field is related to the @EnableAcceptEncodingGzip@ field. If one or
