-- Describes the status of one or more instances. By default, only running instances are described, unless you specifically indicate to return the status of all instances.
--
--
-- Instance status includes the following components:
--
--     * __Status checks__ - Amazon EC2 performs status checks on running EC2 instances to identify hardware and software issues. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html Status Checks for Your Instances> and <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html Troubleshooting Instances with Failed Status Checks> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ .
--
--     * __Scheduled events__ - Amazon EC2 can schedule events (such as reboot, stop, or terminate) for your instances related to hardware issues, software updates, or system maintenance. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html Scheduled Events for Your Instances> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ .
--
--     * __Instance state__ - You can manage your instances from the moment you launch them through their termination. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html Instance Lifecycle> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ .

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeInstanceStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'disIncludeAllInstances' - When @true@ , includes the health status for all instances. When @false@ , includes the health status for running instances only. Default: @false@
--
-- * 'disFilters' - One or more filters.     * @availability-zone@ - The Availability Zone of the instance.     * @event.code@ - The code for the scheduled event (@instance-reboot@ | @system-reboot@ | @system-maintenance@ | @instance-retirement@ | @instance-stop@ ).     * @event.description@ - A description of the event.     * @event.not-after@ - The latest end time for the scheduled event (for example, @2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z@ ).     * @event.not-before@ - The earliest start time for the scheduled event (for example, @2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z@ ).     * @instance-state-code@ - The code for the instance state, as a 16-bit unsigned integer. The high byte is an opaque internal value and should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the state represented. The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shutting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped).     * @instance-state-name@ - The state of the instance (@pending@ | @running@ | @shutting-down@ | @terminated@ | @stopping@ | @stopped@ ).     * @instance-status.reachability@ - Filters on instance status where the name is @reachability@ (@passed@ | @failed@ | @initializing@ | @insufficient-data@ ).     * @instance-status.status@ - The status of the instance (@ok@ | @impaired@ | @initializing@ | @insufficient-data@ | @not-applicable@ ).     * @system-status.reachability@ - Filters on system status where the name is @reachability@ (@passed@ | @failed@ | @initializing@ | @insufficient-data@ ).     * @system-status.status@ - The system status of the instance (@ok@ | @impaired@ | @initializing@ | @insufficient-data@ | @not-applicable@ ).
--
-- * 'disNextToken' - The token to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- * 'disInstanceIds' - One or more instance IDs. Default: Describes all your instances. Constraints: Maximum 100 explicitly specified instance IDs.
--
-- * 'disDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'disMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @NextToken@ value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same call.
