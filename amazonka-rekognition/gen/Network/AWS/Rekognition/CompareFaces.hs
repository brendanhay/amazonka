-- Compares a face in the /source/ input image with each face detected in the /target/ input image.
--
--
-- In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.
--
-- @CompareFaces@ also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.
--
-- If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, @CompareFaces@ returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.
--
-- For an example, see 'get-started-exercise-compare-faces' .
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the @rekognition:CompareFaces@ action.
