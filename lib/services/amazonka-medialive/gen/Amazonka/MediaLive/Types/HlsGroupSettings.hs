    -- the manifest.
    ivInManifest :: Prelude.Maybe HlsIvInManifest,

    -- tags to index segments for playback. A typical use for this value is
    -- when sending the output to AWS Elemental MediaConvert, which can accept
    -- only a single media file. Playback while the channel is running is not
    -- guaranteed due to HTTP server caching.
    tsFileMode :: Prelude.Maybe HlsTsFileMode,

    -- indicate it is I-frame only, and one or more #EXT-X-BYTERANGE entries

    iFrameOnlyPlaylists :: Prelude.Maybe IFrameOnlyPlaylistType,

    -- | If \"vod\", all segments are indexed and kept permanently in the

    -- way to the beginning of the event. VOD mode uses HLS EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE
    -- of EVENT while the channel is running, converting it to a \"VOD\" type
    -- manifest on completion of the stream.
    mode :: Prelude.Maybe HlsMode,

    -- | Specifies whether to include the final (incomplete) segment in the media
    -- output when the pipeline stops producing output because of a channel

    -- let MediaLive control the behavior.
    incompleteSegmentBehavior :: Prelude.Maybe HlsIncompleteSegmentBehavior,
    -- | For use with encryptionType. This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value

    keyFormat :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,

    hlsId3SegmentTagging :: Prelude.Maybe HlsId3SegmentTaggingState,

    outputSelection :: Prelude.Maybe HlsOutputSelection,
    -- | Applies only to 608 Embedded output captions. insert: Include
    -- CLOSED-CAPTIONS lines in the manifest. Specify at least one language in
    -- the CC1 Language Code field. One CLOSED-CAPTION line is added for each
    -- Language Code you specify. Make sure to specify the languages in the
    -- order in which they appear in the original source (if the source is
    -- embedded format) or the order of the caption selectors (if the source is
    -- other than embedded). Otherwise, languages in the manifest will not
    -- match up properly with the output captions. none: Include
    -- CLOSED-CAPTIONS=NONE line in the manifest. omit: Omit any
    -- CLOSED-CAPTIONS line from the manifest.
    captionLanguageSetting :: Prelude.Maybe HlsCaptionLanguageSetting,

    segmentsPerSubdirectory :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural,
    -- | Indicates whether the output manifest should use floating point or
    -- integer values for segment duration.
    manifestDurationFormat :: Prelude.Maybe HlsManifestDurationFormat,
    -- | For use with encryptionType. The IV (Initialization Vector) is a 128-bit

    -- replay.
    clientCache :: Prelude.Maybe HlsClientCache,
    -- | Provides an extra millisecond delta offset to fine tune the timestamps.
    timestampDeltaMilliseconds :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural,
    -- | Optional. One value per output group. Complete this field only if you
    -- are completing Base URL manifest A, and the downstream system has

    -- 0.
    baseUrlManifest1 :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | ENABLED: The master manifest (.m3u8 file) for each pipeline includes
    -- information about both pipelines: first its own media files, then the
    -- media files of the other pipeline. This feature allows playout device

    -- tag of variant manifest.
    streamInfResolution :: Prelude.Maybe HlsStreamInfResolution,

    -- segments to retain in the destination directory. This number should be
    -- bigger than indexNSegments (Num segments). We recommend (value = (2 x
    -- indexNsegments) + 1). If this \"keep segments\" number is too low, the
    -- following might happen: the player is still reading a media manifest
    -- file that lists this segment, but that segment has been removed from the
    -- destination directory (as directed by indexNSegments). This situation
    -- would result in a 404 HTTP error on the player.
    keepSegments :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural,
    -- | Optional. One value per output group. This field is required only if you
