    -- -   @availability-zone@ - The Availability Zone of the Capacity
    --     Reservation.
    --
    -- -   @tenancy@ - Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A
    --     Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:
    --
    --     -   @default@ - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that
    --         is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts.
    --
    --     -   @dedicated@ - The Capacity Reservation is created on
    --         single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single Amazon Web
    --         Services account.
    --
    -- -   @outpost-arn@ - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on
    --     which the Capacity Reservation was created.
    --
    -- -   @state@ - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity
    --     Reservation can be in one of the following states:
    --
    --     -   @active@- The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is
    --         available for your use.
    --
    --     -   @expired@ - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at
    --         the date and time specified in your request. The reserved
    --         capacity is no longer available for your use.
    --
    --     -   @cancelled@ - The Capacity Reservation was cancelled. The
    --         reserved capacity is no longer available for your use.

    --         the capacity provisioning is still pending.
    --
    --     -   @failed@ - The Capacity Reservation request has failed. A
    --         request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity
    --         constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are
    --         retained for 60 minutes.
    --
    -- -   @start-date@ - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation
    --     was started.
    --
    -- -   @end-date@ - The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation
    --     expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity
    --     is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The
    --     Capacity Reservation\'s state changes to expired when it reaches its
    --     end date and time.
    --
    -- -   @end-date-type@ - Indicates the way in which the Capacity
    --     Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the
    --     following end types:
    --
    --     -   @unlimited@ - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you
    --         explicitly cancel it.
    --
    --     -   @limited@ - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a
    --         specified date and time.
    --
    -- -   @instance-match-criteria@ - Indicates the type of instance launches
    --     that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:
    --
    --     -   @open@ - The Capacity Reservation accepts all instances that
    --         have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
    --         Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes
    --         launch into the Capacity Reservation automatically without
    --         specifying any additional parameters.
    --
    --     -   @targeted@ - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances
    --         that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and
    --         Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity
    --         Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use
    --         the reserved capacity.
    --
    -- -   @placement-group-arn@ - The ARN of the cluster placement group in
    --     which the Capacity Reservation was created.
