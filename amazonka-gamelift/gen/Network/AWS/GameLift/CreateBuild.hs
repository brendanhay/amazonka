-- Initializes a new build record and generates information required to upload a game build to Amazon GameLift. Once the build record has been created and is in an INITIALIZED state, you can upload your game build.
--
-- To create a build, use the CLI command 'upload-build', which creates a new build record and uploads the build files in one step. (See the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/ Amazon GameLift Developer Guide> for more details on the CLI and the upload process.) Call the 'CreateBuild' action only if you have your own Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) client and need to manually upload your build files.
--
-- To create a new build, optionally specify a build name and version. This metadata is stored with other properties in the build record and is displayed in the GameLift console (but not visible to players). If successful, this action returns the newly created build record along with an Amazon S3 storage location and AWS account credentials. Use the location and credentials to upload your game build.
