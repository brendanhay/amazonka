    --     permissions settings for the bucket and the object. If the object is

    --
    -- -   S3_OBJECT_EMPTY - Macie can retrieve the object but the object
    --     doesn\'t contain any content. Ensure that the object contains the

    --     access it or it\'s encrypted with an KMS key that you\'re not
    --     allowed to use. Work with your Amazon Web Services administrator to
    --     ensure that the list\'s criteria specify the correct bucket and
