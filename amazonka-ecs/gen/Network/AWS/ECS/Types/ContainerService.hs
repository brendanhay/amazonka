--
-- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of

--     use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
--     Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource

--
-- There are two service scheduler strategies available:
--
-- -   @REPLICA@-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
--     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
--     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
--     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
--     decisions.
--
-- -   @DAEMON@-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
--     each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
--     constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
--     also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
--     will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints.
--
--     Fargate tasks do not support the @DAEMON@ scheduling strategy.
