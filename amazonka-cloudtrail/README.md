## Description

AWS CloudTrail

This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of
actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for
CloudTrail.

CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS
account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded
information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS
API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the
response elements returned by the service.

As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail.
For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests,
managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information
about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the
<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services page>.

See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is
included with each AWS API call listed in the log files.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudtrail)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
