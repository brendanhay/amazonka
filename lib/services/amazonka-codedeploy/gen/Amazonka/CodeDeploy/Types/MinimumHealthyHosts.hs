    -- -   @HOST_COUNT@: The minimum number of healthy instances as an absolute
    --     value.
    --
    -- -   @FLEET_PERCENT@: The minimum number of healthy instances as a
    --     percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment.
    --
    -- In an example of nine instances, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified,
    -- deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment is successful
    -- if six or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the
    -- deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to
    -- five instances at a time. The deployment is successful if four or more
    -- instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails.
    --
    -- In a call to the @GetDeploymentConfig@, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime
    -- returns a minimum healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value
    -- of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a time. (You
    -- cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or
    -- FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime,
    -- CodeDeploy attempts to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a
    -- healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one instance
    -- at a time to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that
    -- if the deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment is
    -- still successful.
