-- Retrieves the resource capacity settings for one or more fleets. The
-- data returned includes the current fleet capacity (number of EC2
-- instances), and settings that can control how capacity scaling. For
-- fleets with remote locations, this operation retrieves data for the
-- fleet\'s home Region only.
--
-- This operation can be used in the following ways:
--
-- -   To get capacity data for one or more specific fleets, provide a list
--     of fleet IDs or fleet ARNs.
--
-- -   To get capacity data for all fleets, do not provide a fleet
--     identifier.
--
-- When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to
-- retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.
--
-- If successful, a @FleetCapacity@ object is returned for each requested
-- fleet ID. Each FleetCapacity object includes a @Location@ property,
-- which is set to the fleet\'s home Region. When a list of fleet IDs is
-- provided, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently
-- exist.
--
-- Some API operations may limit the number of fleet IDs that are allowed
-- in one request. If a request exceeds this limit, the request fails and
-- the error message includes the maximum allowed.
