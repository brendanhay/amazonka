description:
    Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) enables you to configure and
    manage your EC2 instances. You can create a configuration document and
    then associate it with one or more running instances.

    You can use a configuration document to automate the following tasks for
    your Windows instances:

    -   Join an AWS Directory

    -   Install, repair, or uninstall software using an MSI package

    -   Run PowerShell scripts

    -   Configure CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems

    Note that configuration documents are not supported on Linux instances.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.SSM" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ssm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
