-- | Each alias (\"endpoint\") is a fully-qualified name and port number that
-- other tasks (\"clients\") can use to connect to this service.
--
-- Each name and port mapping must be unique within the namespace.
--
-- Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
-- in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
-- clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
-- container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
-- the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
-- Connect. For more information, see
