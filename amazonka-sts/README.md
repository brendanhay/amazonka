## Description

AWS Security Token Service

The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you
to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
(federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For
more detailed information about using this service, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/Welcome.html Using Temporary Security Credentials>.

As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,
which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs
provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to STS. For
example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests,
managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information
about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the
<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services page>.

For information about setting up signatures and authorization through
the API, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html Signing AWS API Requests>
in the /AWS General Reference/. For general information about the Query
API, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html Making Query Requests>
in /Using IAM/. For information about using security tokens with other
AWS products, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/UsingTokens.html Using Temporary Security Credentials to Access AWS>
in /Using Temporary Security Credentials/.

If you\'re new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
specific AWS product, you can find the product\'s technical
documentation at <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.

__Endpoints__

The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of
https:\/\/sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia)
region. Additional regions are available, but must first be activated in
the AWS Management Console before you can use a different region\'s
endpoint. For more information about activating a region for STS see
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/sts-enableregions.html Activating STS in a New Region>
in the /Using Temporary Security Credentials/ guide.

For information about STS endpoints, see
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region Regions and Endpoints>
in the /AWS General Reference/.

__Recording API requests__

STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls
for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By
using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what
requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it
was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to
turn it on and find your log files, see the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html AWS CloudTrail User Guide>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sts)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
