-- This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using
-- InitiateJob. Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated
-- the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault
-- inventory.
--
-- You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output
-- by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job,
-- depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier)
-- returns the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the
-- checksum on the client and verify that the values match to ensure the
-- portion you downloaded is the correct data.
--
-- A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes
-- the job. That a byte range. For both archive and inventory retrieval
-- jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in
-- the headers from the __Get Job Output__ response.
--
-- For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what
-- you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size
-- is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you
-- specify a range of @bytes=0-1048575@, you should verify your download
-- size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected
-- size is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3
-- Glacier The expected size is also returned in the headers from the __Get
-- Job Output__ response.
--
-- In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you
-- specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To
-- ensure the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the
-- checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and verify that
-- the size is what you expected.
--
-- A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes
-- the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24 hours
-- period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
