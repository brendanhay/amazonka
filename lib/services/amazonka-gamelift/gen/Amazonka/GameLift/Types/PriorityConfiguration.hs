-- | Custom prioritization settings for use by a game session queue when
-- placing new game sessions with available game servers. When defined,
-- this configuration replaces the default FleetIQ prioritization process,
-- which is as follows:
--
-- -   If player latency data is included in a game session request,
--     destinations and locations are prioritized first based on lowest
--     average latency (1), then on lowest hosting cost (2), then on
--     destination list order (3), and finally on location (alphabetical)
--     (4). This approach ensures that the queue\'s top priority is to
--     place game sessions where average player latency is lowest, and--if
--     latency is the same--where the hosting cost is less, etc.
--
-- -   If player latency data is not included, destinations and locations
--     are prioritized first on destination list order (1), and then on
--     location (alphabetical) (2). This approach ensures that the queue\'s
--     top priority is to place game sessions on the first destination
--     fleet listed. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session
--     is placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically).
--
-- Changing the priority order will affect how game sessions are placed.
