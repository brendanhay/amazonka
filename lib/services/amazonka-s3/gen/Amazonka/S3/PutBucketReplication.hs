--
-- Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the
-- replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination
-- bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM
-- role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and
-- other relevant information.
--
-- A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can
-- contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
-- replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose
-- additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.
--
-- To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a
-- replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule
-- element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or
-- more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
-- configuration, you must also add the following elements:
-- @DeleteMarkerReplication@, @Status@, and @Priority@.
--
-- If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration,
-- Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations Backward Compatibility>.
--
-- For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html Using Versioning>.
--
-- [Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects]
--     By default, Amazon S3 doesn\'t replicate objects that are stored at
--     rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon
--     Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following:
--     @SourceSelectionCriteria@, @SseKmsEncryptedObjects@, @Status@,
--     @EncryptionConfiguration@, and @ReplicaKmsKeyID@. For information
--     about replication configuration, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys>.
--
--     For information on @PutBucketReplication@ errors, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList List of replication-related error codes>
--
-- [Permissions]
--     To create a @PutBucketReplication@ request, you must have
--     @s3:PutReplicationConfiguration@ permissions for the bucket.
--
--     By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services
--     account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The
--     resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the
--     operation. For more information about permissions, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html Specifying Permissions in a Policy>
--     and
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources>.
--
--     To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action
--     must have the
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html iam:PassRole>
--     permission.
--
-- The following operations are related to @PutBucketReplication@:

-- -   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketReplication.html GetBucketReplication>
--
-- -   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketReplication.html DeleteBucketReplication>
