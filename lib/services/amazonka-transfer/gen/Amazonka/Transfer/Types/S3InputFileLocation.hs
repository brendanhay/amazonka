-- | Specifies the customer input Amazon S3 file location. If it is used
-- inside @copyStepDetails.DestinationFileLocation@, it should be the S3
-- copy destination.
--
-- You need to provide the bucket and key. The key can represent either a
-- path or a file. This is determined by whether or not you end the key
-- value with the forward slash (\/) character. If the final character is
-- \"\/\", then your file is copied to the folder, and its name does not
-- change. If, rather, the final character is alphanumeric, your uploaded
-- file is renamed to the path value. In this case, if a file with that
-- name already exists, it is overwritten.
--
-- For example, if your path is @shared-files\/bob\/@, your uploaded files
-- are copied to the @shared-files\/bob\/@, folder. If your path is
-- @shared-files\/today@, each uploaded file is copied to the
-- @shared-files@ folder and named @today@: each upload overwrites the
-- previous version of the /bob/ file.
