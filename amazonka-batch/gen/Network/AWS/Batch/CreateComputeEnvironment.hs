--
-- Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create @MANAGED@ or
-- @UNMANAGED@ compute environments. @MANAGED@ compute environments can use
-- Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. @UNMANAGED@ compute environments
-- can only use EC2 resources.
--
-- In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and
-- instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is
-- based on the compute resource specification that you define or the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html launch template>
-- that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose
-- either to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances, or to use
-- Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment.
-- You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only
-- launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage
-- of the On-Demand price.
--
-- Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.
--
-- In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute
-- resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your
-- compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMI. However, you
-- need to verify that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI
-- specification. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html container instance AMIs>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/. After you
-- have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the
-- DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster
-- that\'s associated with it. Then, manually launch your container
-- instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html Launching an Amazon ECS container instance>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- AWS Batch doesn\'t upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it\'s
-- created. For example, it doesn\'t update the AMIs when a newer version
-- of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you\'re
-- responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including
-- updates and security patches) and any additional application software or
-- utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI
-- for your AWS Batch jobs, complete these steps:
--
-- 1.  Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.
--
-- 2.  Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.
--
-- 3.  Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.
--
-- 4.  Delete the earlier compute environment.
