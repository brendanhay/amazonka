-- Retrieves information about a fleet\'s instances, including instance
-- IDs. Use this operation to get details on all instances in the fleet or
-- get details on one specific instance.
--
-- To get a specific instance, specify fleet ID and instance ID. To get all
-- instances in a fleet, specify a fleet ID only. Use the pagination
-- parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If
-- successful, an Instance object is returned for each result.
