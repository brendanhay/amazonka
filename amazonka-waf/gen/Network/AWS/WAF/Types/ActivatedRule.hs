-- | This is __AWS WAF Classic__ documentation. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html AWS WAF Classic>
-- in the developer guide.
--
-- __For the latest version of AWS WAF__, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html AWS WAF Developer Guide>.
-- With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for
-- regional and global use.
--
-- The @ActivatedRule@ object in an UpdateWebACL request specifies a @Rule@
-- that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the @Rule@ in the
-- @WebACL@, and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web
-- request matches the @Rule@ (@ALLOW@, @BLOCK@, or @COUNT@).
--
-- To specify whether to insert or delete a @Rule@, use the @Action@
-- parameter in the WebACLUpdate data type.
--
-- /See:/ 'newActivatedRule' smart constructor.
data ActivatedRule = ActivatedRule'
  { -- | An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only
    -- when the @ActivatedRule@ refers to a @RuleGroup@.
    --
    -- Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking
    -- traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is
    -- to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the
    -- legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You
    -- can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace
    -- rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.
    --
    -- Specifying @ExcludedRules@ does not remove those rules from the rule
    -- group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to @COUNT@.
    -- Therefore, requests that match an @ExcludedRule@ are counted but not
    -- blocked. The @RuleGroup@ owner will receive COUNT metrics for each
    -- @ExcludedRule@.
    --
    -- If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already
    -- associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:
    --
    -- 1.  Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want
    --     to exclude. For more information about the logs, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging.html Logging Web ACL Traffic Information>.
    --
    -- 2.  Submit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:
    --
    --     -   The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web
    --         ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first
    --         @Updates:Action@ should be @DELETE@ and
    --         @Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId@ should be the rule group that
    --         contains the rules that you want to exclude.
    --
    --     -   The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but
    --         specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second
    --         @Updates:Action@ should be @INSERT@,
    --         @Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId@ should be the rule group that you
    --         just removed, and @ExcludedRules@ should contain the rules that
    --         you want to exclude.

    --
    -- Any rule in a @RuleGroup@ can potentially block a request. If you set

    -- any individual rule in the @RuleGroup@ matches the request and is
    -- configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the
    -- @RuleGroup@, set the @OverrideAction@ to @Count@. The @RuleGroup@ will
    -- then override any block action specified by individual rules contained
    -- within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests
    -- will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using

    --

    --     code.
    --
    -- -   @COUNT@: AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the
    --     conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request
    --     based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.
    --
