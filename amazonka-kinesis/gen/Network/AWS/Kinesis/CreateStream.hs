--
-- Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data
-- records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or
-- /producers/. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means
-- of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a
-- stream.
--
-- You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed
-- of. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up
-- to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support
-- writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total
-- of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases,
-- you can add or remove shards.
--
-- The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS
-- account used by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That
-- is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and
-- two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have
-- the same name.
--
-- @CreateStream@ is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a
-- @CreateStream@ request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and
-- sets the stream status to @CREATING@. After the stream is created,
-- Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to @ACTIVE@. You should
-- perform read and write operations only on an @ACTIVE@ stream.
--
-- You receive a @LimitExceededException@ when making a @CreateStream@
-- request when you try to do one of the following:
--
-- -   Have more than five streams in the @CREATING@ state at any point in
--     time.
--
-- -   Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
--
-- For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits>
-- in the /Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide/. To increase this
-- limit,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html contact AWS Support>.
--
-- You can use @DescribeStream@ to check the stream status, which is
-- returned in @StreamStatus@.
--
-- CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
