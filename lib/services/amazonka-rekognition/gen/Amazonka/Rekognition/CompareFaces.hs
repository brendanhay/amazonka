--
-- Compares a face in the /source/ input image with each of the 100 largest
-- faces detected in the /target/ input image.
--
-- If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the
-- largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target
-- image.
--
-- CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic.
-- A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target
-- image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in
-- the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we
-- recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source
-- images. If you plan to use @CompareFaces@ to make a decision that
-- impacts an individual\'s rights, privacy, or access to services, we
-- recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further
-- validation before taking action.
--
-- You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image
-- bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the
-- AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes
-- isn\'t supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
--
-- In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by
-- similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response
-- provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details
-- (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and
-- confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding
-- box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score,
-- which indicates how closely the faces match.
--
-- By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal
-- to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by
-- specifying the @SimilarityThreshold@ parameter.
--
-- @CompareFaces@ also returns an array of faces that don\'t match the
-- source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence
-- value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns
-- information about the face in the source image, including the bounding
-- box of the face and confidence value.
--
-- The @QualityFilter@ input parameter allows you to filter out detected
-- faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based
-- on a variety of common use cases. Use @QualityFilter@ to set the quality
-- bar by specifying @LOW@, @MEDIUM@, or @HIGH@. If you do not want to
-- filter detected faces, specify @NONE@. The default value is @NONE@.
--
-- If the image doesn\'t contain Exif metadata, @CompareFaces@ returns
-- orientation information for the source and target images. Use these
-- values to display the images with the correct image orientation.
--
-- If no faces are detected in the source or target images, @CompareFaces@
-- returns an @InvalidParameterException@ error.
--
-- This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this
-- operation doesn\'t persist.
--
-- For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition
-- Developer Guide.
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the
-- @rekognition:CompareFaces@ action.
