-- Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
-- key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) that you can use to
-- access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to.
-- Typically, you use 'AssumeRole' for cross-account access or federation.
--
-- __Important:__ You cannot call 'AssumeRole' by using AWS account
-- credentials; access will be denied. You must use IAM user credentials or
-- temporary security credentials to call 'AssumeRole'.
--
-- For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
-- need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
-- credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing
-- all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account
-- can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term
-- credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials
-- to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts.
-- For more information about roles, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)>
-- in /Using IAM/.
--
-- For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the
-- AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and
-- authentication system in your corporate network, you don\'t have to
-- recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities
-- access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call
-- 'AssumeRole' (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to
-- get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary
-- security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to
-- access the console. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/STSUseCases.html Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access>
-- in /Using Temporary Security Credentials/.
--
-- The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you
-- specified when calling 'AssumeRole', which can be from 900 seconds (15
-- minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.
--
-- Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you
-- choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are
-- returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the
-- access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to
-- this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by
-- the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access
-- policy of the role that is being assumed, /__and__/ the policy that you
-- pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the
-- resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed
-- policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the
-- access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information,
-- see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/permissions-assume-role.html Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity>
-- in /Using Temporary Security Credentials/.
--
-- To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The
-- trust relationship is defined in the role\'s trust policy when the role
-- is created. You must also have a policy that allows you to call
-- 'sts:AssumeRole'.
--
-- __Using MFA with AssumeRole__
--
-- You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
-- when you call 'AssumeRole'. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
-- in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role
-- has been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the
-- trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests
-- for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA
-- information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in
-- a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the
-- following example.
--
-- '\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}'
--
-- For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html Configuring MFA-Protected API Access>
-- in /Using IAM/ guide.
--
-- To use MFA with 'AssumeRole', you pass values for the 'SerialNumber' and
-- 'TokenCode' parameters. The 'SerialNumber' value identifies the user\'s
-- hardware or virtual MFA device. The 'TokenCode' is the time-based
-- one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces.

-- | An IAM policy in JSON format.
