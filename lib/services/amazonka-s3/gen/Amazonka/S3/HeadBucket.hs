--
-- This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have
-- permission to access it. The action returns a @200 OK@ if the bucket
-- exists and you have permission to access it.
--
-- If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it,
-- the @HEAD@ request returns a generic @400 Bad Request@, @403 Forbidden@
-- or @404 Not Found@ code. A message body is not included, so you cannot
-- determine the exception beyond these error codes.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
-- @s3:ListBucket@ action. The bucket owner has this permission by default
-- and can grant this permission to others. For more information about
-- permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources>.
--
-- To use this API operation against an access point, you must provide the
-- alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the
-- access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct
-- requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes
-- the form
-- /AccessPointName/-/AccountId/.s3-accesspoint./Region/.amazonaws.com.
-- When using the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the ARN in place of
-- the bucket name. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html Using access points>.
--
-- To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, provide
-- the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name.
-- If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the
-- error code @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@ is returned. For more
-- information about @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList List of Error Codes>.
