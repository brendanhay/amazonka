data SetSMSAttributes = SetSMSAttributes'
  { -- | The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You can
    -- set values for the following attribute names:
    --
    -- @MonthlySpendLimit@ – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to
    -- spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines that
    -- sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it
    -- stops sending SMS messages within minutes.
    --
    -- Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being
    -- crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you
    -- will incur costs that exceed your limit.
    --
    -- By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS.
    -- If you want to raise the limit, submit an
    -- <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sns SNS Limit Increase case>.
    -- For __New limit value__, enter your desired monthly spend limit. In the
    -- __Use Case Description__ field, explain that you are requesting an SMS
    -- monthly spend limit increase.
    --
    -- @DeliveryStatusIAMRole@ – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS
    -- to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS
    -- message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message
    -- price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the
    -- message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.
    --
    -- @DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate@ – The percentage of successful SMS
    -- deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The
    -- value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only
    -- for failed deliveries, set this value to @0@. To write logs for 10% of
    -- your successful deliveries, set it to @10@.
    --
    -- @DefaultSenderID@ – A string, such as your business brand, that is
    -- displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs
    -- varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters,
    -- and it must contain at least one letter.
    --
    -- @DefaultSMSType@ – The type of SMS message that you will send by
    -- default. You can assign the following values:
    --
    -- -   @Promotional@ – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing
    --     messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the
    --     lowest cost.
    --
    -- -   @Transactional@ – Critical messages that support customer
    --     transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor
    --     authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve
    --     the highest reliability.
    --
    -- @UsageReportS3Bucket@ – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
    -- daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will
    -- deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes
    -- the following information for each SMS message that was successfully
    -- delivered by your account:
    --
    -- -   Time that the message was published (in UTC)
    --
    -- -   Message ID
    --
    -- -   Destination phone number
    --
    -- -   Message type
    --
    -- -   Delivery status
    --
    -- -   Message price (in USD)
    --
    -- -   Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too
    --     long for a single message)
    --
    -- -   Total number of parts
    --
    -- To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the
    -- Amazon SNS service principle to perform the @s3:PutObject@ and
    -- @s3:GetBucketLocation@ actions.
    --
    -- For an example bucket policy and usage report, see
    -- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sms_stats.html Monitoring SMS Activity>
