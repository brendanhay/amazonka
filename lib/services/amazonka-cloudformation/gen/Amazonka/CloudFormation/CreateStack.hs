-- -   @CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND@
--
--     Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on
--     templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace
--     operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire
--     templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from
--     the processed template, so that they can review the changes
--     resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If
--     your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to
--     create a stack directly from the processed template, without first
--     reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must
--     acknowledge this capability. This includes the
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html AWS::Include>
--     and
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html AWS::Serverless>
--     transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.
--
--     If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains
--     macros /and/ nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from
--     the template using this capability.
--
--     You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that
--     contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs.
--
--     Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for
--     processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner
--     can update the function operation without CloudFormation being
--     notified.
