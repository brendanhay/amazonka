-- Updates a continuous deployment policy. You can update a continuous
-- deployment policy to enable or disable it, to change the percentage of
-- traffic that it sends to the staging distribution, or to change the
-- staging distribution that it sends traffic to.
--
-- When you update a continuous deployment policy configuration, all the
-- fields are updated with the values that are provided in the request. You
-- cannot update some fields independent of others. To update a continuous
-- deployment policy configuration:
--
-- 1.  Use @GetContinuousDeploymentPolicyConfig@ to get the current
--     configuration.
--
-- 2.  Locally modify the fields in the continuous deployment policy
--     configuration that you want to update.
--
-- 3.  Use @UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicy@, providing the entire
--     continuous deployment policy configuration, including the fields
--     that you modified and those that you didn\'t.
