-- | The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container
-- can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for
-- container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed.
--
-- Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of
-- the container agent to enable container dependencies. However, we
-- recommend using the latest container agent version. For information
-- about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/. If you are
-- using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least
-- version 1.26.0-1 of the @ecs-init@ package. If your container instances
-- are launched from version @20190301@ or later, then they contain the
-- required versions of the container agent and @ecs-init@. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- For tasks using the Fargate launch type, this parameter requires that
-- the task or service uses platform version 1.3.0 or later.

    -- -   @COMPLETE@ - This condition validates that a dependent container
    --     runs to completion (exits) before permitting other containers to
    --     start. This can be useful for nonessential containers that run a
    --     script and then exit. This condition cannot be set on an essential
    --     container.
    --
    -- -   @SUCCESS@ - This condition is the same as @COMPLETE@, but it also
    --     requires that the container exits with a @zero@ status. This

    --
    -- -   @HEALTHY@ - This condition validates that the dependent container
    --     passes its Docker health check before permitting other containers to
    --     start. This requires that the dependent container has health checks
    --     configured. This condition is confirmed only at task startup.
