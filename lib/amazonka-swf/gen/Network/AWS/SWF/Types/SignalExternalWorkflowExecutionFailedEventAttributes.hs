-- | Creates a value of 'SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'sewefeaControl' - The data attached to the event that the decider can use in subsequent workflow tasks. This data isn't sent to the workflow execution.
--
-- * 'sewefeaRunId' - The @runId@ of the external workflow execution that the signal was being delivered to.
--
-- * 'sewefeaWorkflowId' - The @workflowId@ of the external workflow execution that the signal was being delivered to.
--
-- * 'sewefeaCause' - The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.
--
-- * 'sewefeaInitiatedEventId' - The ID of the @SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event corresponding to the @SignalExternalWorkflowExecution@ decision to request this signal. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
--
-- * 'sewefeaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @SignalExternalWorkflowExecution@ decision for this signal. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
