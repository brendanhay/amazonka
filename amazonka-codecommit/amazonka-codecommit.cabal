    AWS CodeCommit

    This is the /AWS CodeCommit API Reference/. This reference provides
    descriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API.

    You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:

    -   Repositories, by calling the following:
        -   < BatchGetRepositories>, which returns information about one or
            more repositories associated with your AWS account
        -   < CreateRepository>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository
        -   < DeleteRepository>, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository
        -   < GetRepository>, which returns information about a specified
            repository
        -   < ListRepositories>, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories
            associated with your AWS account
        -   < UpdateRepositoryDescription>, which sets or updates the
            description of the repository
        -   < UpdateRepositoryName>, which changes the name of the
            repository. If you change the name of a repository, no other
            users of that repository will be able to access it until you
            send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.
    -   Branches, by calling the following:
        -   < CreateBranch>, which creates a new branch in a specified
            repository
        -   < GetBranch>, which returns information about a specified branch
        -   < ListBranches>, which lists all branches for a specified
            repository
        -   < UpdateDefaultBranch>, which changes the default branch for a
            repository
    -   Information about committed code in a repository, by calling the
        following:
        -   < GetCommit>, which returns information about a commit,
            including commit messages and committer information.
    -   Triggers, by calling the following:
        -   < GetRepositoryTriggers>, which returns information about
            triggers configured for a repository
        -   < PutRepositoryTriggers>, which replaces all triggers for a
            repository and can be used to create or delete triggers
        -   < TestRepositoryTriggers>, which tests the functionality of a
            repository trigger by sending data to the trigger target

    For information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html AWS CodeCommit User Guide>.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
