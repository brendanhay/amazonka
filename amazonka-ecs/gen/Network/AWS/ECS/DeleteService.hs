-- Deletes a specified service within a cluster. You can delete a service
-- if you have no running tasks in it and the desired task count is zero.
-- If the service is actively maintaining tasks, you cannot delete it, and
-- you must update the service to a desired task count of zero. For more
-- information, see UpdateService.
--
-- When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require
-- cleanup, the service status moves from @ACTIVE@ to @DRAINING@, and the
-- service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API
-- operation. After all tasks have transitioned to either @STOPPING@ or
-- @STOPPED@ status, the service status moves from @DRAINING@ to
-- @INACTIVE@. Services in the @DRAINING@ or @INACTIVE@ status can still be
-- viewed with the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future,
-- @INACTIVE@ services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record
-- keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return a
-- @ServiceNotFoundException@ error.
--
-- If you attempt to create a new service with the same name as an existing
-- service in either @ACTIVE@ or @DRAINING@ status, you receive an error.
