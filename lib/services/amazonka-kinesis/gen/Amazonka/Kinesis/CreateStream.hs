-- Creates a Kinesis data stream. A stream captures and transports data
-- records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or
-- /producers/. Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means
-- of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a
-- stream.
--
-- You can create your data stream using either on-demand or provisioned
-- capacity mode. Data streams with an on-demand mode require no capacity
-- planning and automatically scale to handle gigabytes of write and read
-- throughput per minute. With the on-demand mode, Kinesis Data Streams
-- automatically manages the shards in order to provide the necessary
-- throughput. For the data streams with a provisioned mode, you must
-- specify the number of shards for the data stream. Each shard can support
-- reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read
-- total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000
-- records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per
-- second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add
-- or remove shards.
--
-- The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the Amazon
-- Web Services account used by the application. It is also scoped by
-- Amazon Web Services Region. That is, two streams in two different
-- accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account,
-- but in two different Regions, can have the same name.
--
-- @CreateStream@ is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a
-- @CreateStream@ request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and
-- sets the stream status to @CREATING@. After the stream is created,
-- Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to @ACTIVE@. You should
-- perform read and write operations only on an @ACTIVE@ stream.
--
-- You receive a @LimitExceededException@ when making a @CreateStream@
-- request when you try to do one of the following:
--
-- -   Have more than five streams in the @CREATING@ state at any point in
--     time.
--
-- -   Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
--
-- For the default shard limit for an Amazon Web Services account, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits>
-- in the /Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide/. To increase this
-- limit,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html contact Amazon Web Services Support>.
--
-- You can use DescribeStreamSummary to check the stream status, which is
-- returned in @StreamStatus@.
--
-- CreateStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
