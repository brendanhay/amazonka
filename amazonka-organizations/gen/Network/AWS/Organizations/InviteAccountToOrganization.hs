-- Sends an invitation to another account to join your organization as a
-- member account. AWS Organizations sends email on your behalf to the
-- email address that is associated with the other account\'s owner. The
-- invitation is implemented as a Handshake whose details are in the
-- response.
--
-- -   You can invite AWS accounts only from the same seller as the
--     management account. For example, if your organization\'s management
--     account was created by Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), an
--     AWS seller in India, you can invite only other AISPL accounts to
--     your organization. You can\'t combine accounts from AISPL and AWS or
--     from any other AWS seller. For more information, see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilliing-India.html Consolidated Billing in India>.
--
-- -   If you receive an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
--     account limits for the organization or that the operation failed
--     because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
--     then try again. If the error persists after an hour, contact
--     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ AWS Support>.
--
-- If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
-- @organizations:TagResource@ permission.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account.
