## Description

Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets
you launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API
calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized
service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like
security groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.

You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and
availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the
need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration
management systems or worry about scaling your management
infrastructure.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ecs)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
