-- | Creates a value of 'StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'scwefeaControl' - The data attached to the event that the decider can use in subsequent workflow tasks. This data isn't sent to the child workflow execution.
--
-- * 'scwefeaWorkflowType' - The workflow type provided in the @StartChildWorkflowExecution@ 'Decision' that failed.
--
-- * 'scwefeaCause' - The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.
--
-- * 'scwefeaWorkflowId' - The @workflowId@ of the child workflow execution.
--
-- * 'scwefeaInitiatedEventId' - When the @cause@ is @WORKFLOW_ALREADY_RUNNING@ , @initiatedEventId@ is the ID of the @StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event that corresponds to the @StartChildWorkflowExecution@ 'Decision' to start the workflow execution. You can use this information to diagnose problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event. When the @cause@ isn't @WORKFLOW_ALREADY_RUNNING@ , @initiatedEventId@ is set to @0@ because the @StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event doesn't exist.
--
-- * 'scwefeaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @StartChildWorkflowExecution@ 'Decision' to request this child workflow execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events.
