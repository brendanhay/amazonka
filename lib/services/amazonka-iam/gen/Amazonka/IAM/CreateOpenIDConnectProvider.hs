--
-- Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that
-- supports <http://openid.net/connect/ OpenID Connect (OIDC)>.
--
-- The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a
-- principal in a role\'s trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust
-- relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.
--
-- If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or
-- Amazon Cognito, you don\'t need to create a separate IAM identity
-- provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon
-- Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move
-- directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn
-- more, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:
--
-- -   The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust
--
-- -   A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the
--     application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC
--     provider
--
-- -   A list of tags that are attached to the specified IAM OIDC provider
--
-- -   A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the
--     IdP uses
--
-- You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to
-- access Amazon Web Services.
--
-- Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity
-- providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities
-- (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP
-- server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, Auth0, and those
-- that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint.
-- In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration,
-- but is no longer used for validation.
--
-- The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that
-- this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the
-- CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to highly privileged users.
