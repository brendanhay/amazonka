-- Sends you notification through CloudWatch Events when all files written
-- to your file share have been uploaded to Amazon S3.
--
-- AWS Storage Gateway can send a notification through Amazon CloudWatch
-- Events when all files written to your file share up to that point in
-- time have been uploaded to Amazon S3. These files include files written
-- to the file share up to the time that you make a request for
-- notification. When the upload is done, Storage Gateway sends you
-- notification through an Amazon CloudWatch Event. You can configure
-- CloudWatch Events to send the notification through event targets such as
-- Amazon SNS or AWS Lambda function. This operation is only supported for
-- file gateways.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-upload-notification Getting file upload notification>
