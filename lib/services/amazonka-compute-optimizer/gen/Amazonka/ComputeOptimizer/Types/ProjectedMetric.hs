-- | Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommendation option,
-- such as an Amazon EC2 instance. This represents the projected
-- utilization of a recommendation option had you used that resource during
-- the analyzed period.
--
-- Compare the utilization metric data of your resource against its
-- projected utilization metric data to determine the performance
-- difference between your current resource and the recommended option.
--
-- The @Cpu@ and @Memory@ metrics are the only projected utilization
-- metrics returned when you run the GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics
-- action. Additionally, the @Memory@ metric is returned only for resources
-- that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch Agent>.

  { -- | The name of the projected utilization metric.

    -- The following projected utilization metrics are returned:
    --
    -- -   @Cpu@ - The projected percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that
    --     would be in use on the recommendation option had you used that
    --     resource during the analyzed period. This metric identifies the
    --     processing power required to run an application on the
    --     recommendation option.
    --
    --     Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can
    --     show a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not
    --     allocated a full processor core.
    --
    --     Units: Percent
    --
    -- -   @Memory@ - The percentage of memory that would be in use on the
    --     recommendation option had you used that resource during the analyzed
    --     period. This metric identifies the amount of memory required to run
    --     an application on the recommendation option.
