-- | Creates a value of 'UpdateMatchmakingConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'umcGameProperties' - Set of developer-defined properties for a game session, formatted as a set of type:value pairs. These properties are included in the 'GameSession' object, which is passed to the game server with a request to start a new game session (see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match.
--
-- * 'umcRuleSetName' - Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.
--
-- * 'umcAcceptanceTimeoutSeconds' - Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.
--
-- * 'umcRequestTimeoutSeconds' - Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.
--
-- * 'umcNotificationTarget' - SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking> for more information.
--
-- * 'umcGameSessionQueueARNs' - Amazon Resource Name (<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is @arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912@ . These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.
--
-- * 'umcCustomEventData' - Information to attached to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.
--
-- * 'umcAcceptanceRequired' - Flag that determines whether or not a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.
--
-- * 'umcGameSessionData' - Set of developer-defined game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is included in the 'GameSession' object, which is passed to the game server with a request to start a new game session (see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match.
--
-- * 'umcDescription' - Descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.
--
-- * 'umcAdditionalPlayerCount' - Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.
--
-- * 'umcName' - Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration to update.
