-- Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
-- custom matchmaking rules. If you\'re also using GameLift hosting, a new
-- game session is started for the matched players. Each matchmaking
-- request identifies one or more players to find a match for, and
-- specifies the type of match to build, including the team configuration
-- and the rules for an acceptable match. When a matchmaking request
-- identifies a group of players who want to play together, FlexMatch finds
-- additional players to fill the match. Match type, rules, and other
-- features are defined in a @MatchmakingConfiguration@.
--
-- To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
-- configuration, and include the players to be matched. For each player,
-- you must also include the player attribute values that are required by
-- the matchmaking configuration (in the rule set). If successful, a
-- matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to @QUEUED@.
--
-- Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed. If you\'re also
-- using GameLift hosting, a successfully completed ticket contains game
-- session connection information. Ticket status updates are tracked using
-- event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS),
-- which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.
