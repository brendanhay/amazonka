-- Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions.
--
-- This action can be used in the following ways:
--
-- -   To retrieve a specific player session, provide the player session ID
--     only.
--
-- -   To retrieve all player sessions in a game session, provide the game
--     session ID only.
--
-- -   To retrieve all player sessions for a specific player, provide a
--     player ID only.
--
-- To request player sessions, specify either a player session ID, game
-- session ID, or player ID. You can filter this request by player session
-- status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of
-- sequential pages.
--
-- If successful, a @PlayerSession@ object is returned for each session
-- that matches the request.
