-- | A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web
-- requests that you can use in a WebACL. When you create a rule group, you
-- define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must
-- stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group
-- with confidence in its capacity requirements.
