## Description

AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This is the AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference. This guide provides
detailed information about AWS Elastic Beanstalk actions, data types,
parameters, and errors.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a tool that makes it easy for you to create,
deploy, and manage scalable, fault-tolerant applications running on
Amazon Web Services cloud resources.

For more information about this product, go to the
<http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/ AWS Elastic Beanstalk> details
page. The location of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk WSDL is
<http://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl>.
To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to
access the API, go to
<https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.

__Endpoints__

For a list of region-specific endpoints that AWS Elastic Beanstalk
supports, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region Regions and Endpoints>
in the /Amazon Web Services Glossary/.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticbeanstalk)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
