--
-- This implementation of the DELETE operation uses the policy subresource
-- to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
-- other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the
-- calling identity must have the @DeleteBucketPolicy@ permissions on the
-- specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner\'s account to use this
-- operation.
--
-- If you don\'t have @DeleteBucketPolicy@ permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
-- @403 Access Denied@ error. If you have the correct permissions, but
-- you\'re not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner\'s
-- account, Amazon S3 returns a @405 Method Not Allowed@ error.
--
-- As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a
-- bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly
-- denies the root user the ability to perform this action.
--
-- For more information about bucket policies, see
-- <%20https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html Using Bucket Policies and UserPolicies>.
