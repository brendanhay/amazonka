-- | Creates a value of 'GetBotResponse' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'gbrsFailureReason' - If @status@ is @FAILED@ , Amazon Lex explains why it failed to build the bot.
--
-- * 'gbrsStatus' - The status of the bot. If the bot is ready to run, the status is @READY@ . If there was a problem with building the bot, the status is @FAILED@ and the @failureReason@ explains why the bot did not build. If the bot was saved but not built, the status is @NOT BUILT@ .
--
-- * 'gbrsAbortStatement' - The message that Amazon Lex returns when the user elects to end the conversation without completing it. For more information, see 'PutBot' .
--
-- * 'gbrsIntents' - An array of @intent@ objects. For more information, see 'PutBot' .
--
-- * 'gbrsChecksum' - Checksum of the bot used to identify a specific revision of the bot's @> LATEST@ version.
--
-- * 'gbrsLocale' - The target locale for the bot.
--
-- * 'gbrsCreatedDate' - The date that the bot was created.
--
-- * 'gbrsName' - The name of the bot.
--
-- * 'gbrsVersion' - The version of the bot. For a new bot, the version is always @> LATEST@ .
--
-- * 'gbrsIdleSessionTTLInSeconds' - The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a conversation. For more information, see 'PutBot' .
--
-- * 'gbrsClarificationPrompt' - The message Amazon Lex uses when it doesn't understand the user's request. For more information, see 'PutBot' .
--
-- * 'gbrsVoiceId' - The Amazon Polly voice ID that Amazon Lex uses for voice interaction with the user. For more information, see 'PutBot' .
--
-- * 'gbrsLastUpdatedDate' - The date that the bot was updated. When you create a resource, the creation date and last updated date are the same.
--
-- * 'gbrsChildDirected' - For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specifying @true@ or @false@ in the @childDirected@ field. By specifying @true@ in the @childDirected@ field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex __is__ related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying @false@ in the @childDirected@ field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex __is not__ related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for the @childDirected@ field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under COPPA.
