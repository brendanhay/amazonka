-- | Describes information used to create a step adjustment for a step
-- scaling policy.
--
-- For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach
-- threshold of 50:
--
-- -   To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal
--     to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper
--     bound of 10.
--
-- -   To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and
--     less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper
--     bound of 0.
--
-- There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:
--
-- -   The ranges of your step adjustments can\'t overlap or have a gap.
--
-- -   At most, one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one
--     step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a
--     step adjustment with a null lower bound.
--
-- -   At most, one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one
--     step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a
--     step adjustment with a null upper bound.
--
-- -   The upper and lower bound can\'t be null in the same step
--     adjustment.
