-- Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. Each time you transition an
-- instance from stopped to started, Amazon EC2 charges a full instance
-- hour, even if transitions happen multiple times within a single hour.
--
-- You can\'t start or stop Spot Instances.
--
-- Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be
-- quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute
-- resources are released and you are not billed for hourly instance usage.
-- However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains, continues to
-- persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You
-- can restart your instance at any time.
--
-- Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it
-- can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in
-- RAM.
--
-- Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as
-- its root device returns an error.
--
-- You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only
-- terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance
-- differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an
-- instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance
-- persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other
-- devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted.
-- For more information about the differences between stopping and
-- terminating instances, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html Instance Lifecycle>
