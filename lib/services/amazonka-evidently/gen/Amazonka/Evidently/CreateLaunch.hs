-- Creates a /launch/ of a given feature. Before you create a launch, you
-- must create the feature to use for the launch.
--
-- You can use a launch to safely validate new features by serving them to
-- a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You
-- can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when
-- to ramp up traffic to more users. This helps you reduce risk and
-- identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.
--
-- Don\'t use this operation to update an existing launch. Instead, use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateLaunch.html UpdateLaunch>.
