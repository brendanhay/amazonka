-- Retrieves build records for all builds associated with the AWS account in use. You can limit results to builds that are in a specific status by using the @Status@ parameter. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results in a set of sequential pages.

--
-- * 'lbStatus' - Build status to filter results by. To retrieve all builds, leave this parameter empty. Possible build statuses include the following:     * __INITIALIZED__ – A new build has been defined, but no files have been uploaded. You cannot create fleets for builds that are in this status. When a build is successfully created, the build status is set to this value.      * __READY__ – The game build has been successfully uploaded. You can now create new fleets for this build.     * __FAILED__ – The game build upload failed. You cannot create new fleets for this build.
--
-- * 'lbNextToken' - Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value.
--
-- * 'lbLimit' - Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with @NextToken@ to get results as a set of sequential pages.
