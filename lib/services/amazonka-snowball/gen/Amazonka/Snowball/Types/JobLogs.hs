-- | Contains job logs. Whenever a Snow device is used to import data into or
-- export data out of Amazon S3, you\'ll have the option of downloading a
-- PDF job report. Job logs are returned as a part of the response syntax
-- of the @DescribeJob@ action in the @JobMetadata@ data type. The job logs
-- can be accessed for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made.
-- To access any of the job logs after 60 minutes have passed, you\'ll have
-- to make another call to the @DescribeJob@ action.
--
-- For import jobs, the PDF job report becomes available at the end of the
-- import process. For export jobs, your job report typically becomes
-- available while the Snow device for your job part is being delivered to
-- you.
--
-- The job report provides you insight into the state of your Amazon S3
-- data transfer. The report includes details about your job or job part
-- for your records.
--
-- For deeper visibility into the status of your transferred objects, you
-- can look at the two associated logs: a success log and a failure log.
-- The logs are saved in comma-separated value (CSV) format, and the name
-- of each log includes the ID of the job or job part that the log
-- describes.
--
-- /See:/ 'newJobLogs' smart constructor.
