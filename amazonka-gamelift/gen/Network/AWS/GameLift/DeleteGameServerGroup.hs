-- __This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and
-- game server groups.__
--
-- Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server
-- group record. You have several options for how these resources are
-- impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of
-- delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:
--
-- -   The game server group
--
-- -   The corresponding Auto Scaling group
--
-- -   All game servers that are currently running in the group
--
-- To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete
-- and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups
-- can only be deleted if they are in @ACTIVE@ or @ERROR@ status.
--
-- If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked
-- off. The game server group status is changed to @DELETE_SCHEDULED@,
-- which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops
-- automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server
-- group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources.
-- If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in
-- @ERROR@ status.
--
-- GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.
