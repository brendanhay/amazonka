-- 'maxIdleConnectionsPercent', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_maxIdleConnectionsPercent' - Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the
-- connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high

-- 'connectionBorrowTimeout', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_connectionBorrowTimeout' - The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become
-- available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened
-- its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with
-- client sessions.
--
-- 'initQuery', 'connectionPoolConfigurationInfo_initQuery' - One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new
-- database connection. Typically used with @SET@ statements to make sure
-- that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and
