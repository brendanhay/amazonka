--
-- Enables or updates server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.
--
--
-- Starting encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Amazon Kinesis returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to @UPDATING@ . After the update is complete, Amazon Kinesis sets the status of the stream back to @ACTIVE@ . Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is @UPDATING@ . Once the status of the stream is @ACTIVE@ , records written to the stream will begin to be encrypted.
--
-- API Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24 hour period.
--
-- Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an @ACTIVE@ status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After youâ€™ve enabled encryption, you can verify encryption was applied by inspecting the API response from @PutRecord@ or @PutRecords@ .
