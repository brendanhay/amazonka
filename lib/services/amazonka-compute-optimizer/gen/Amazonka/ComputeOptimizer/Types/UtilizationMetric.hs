-- | Describes a utilization metric of a resource, such as an Amazon EC2

    --
    -- The following utilization metrics are available:
    --
    -- -   @Cpu@ - The percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are
    --     currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the
    --     processing power required to run an application on the instance.
    --
    --     Depending on the instance type, tools in your operating system can
    --     show a lower percentage than CloudWatch when the instance is not
    --     allocated a full processor core.
    --
    --     Units: Percent
    --
    -- -   @Memory@ - The percentage of memory that is currently in use on the

    --     run an application on the instance.
    --
    --     Units: Percent
    --
