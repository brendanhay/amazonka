## Description

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides resizable computing
capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2
eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop
and deploy applications faster.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ec2)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
