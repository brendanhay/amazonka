-- Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file system on EC2 instances via the mount target.
--
-- You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order to access their file system. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html Amazon EFS: How it Works>.
--
-- In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are creating the mount target and the file system\'s lifecycle state must be \"available\" (see < DescribeFileSystems>).
--
-- In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which serves several purposes:
--
-- -   It determines the VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target.
-- -   It determines the Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target.
-- -   It determines the IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of the mount target if you don\'t specify an IP address in the request.
--
-- After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that includes, a 'MountTargetId' and an 'IpAddress'. You use this IP address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount target\'s DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance on which you mount the file system via the mount target can resolve the mount target\'s DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation How it Works: Implementation Overview>.
--
-- Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the request to add another mount target must meet the following requirements:
--
-- -   The subnet specified in the request must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount targets.
--
-- -   The subnet specified in the request must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets of the existing mount targets.
--
-- If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the following:
--
-- -   Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.
-- -   Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:
--
--     -   If the request provides an 'IpAddress', Amazon EFS assigns that IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2 'CreateNetworkInterface' call does when a request does not specify a primary private IP address).
--     -   If the request provides 'SecurityGroups', this network interface is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the subnet\'s VPC.
--     -   Assigns the description '\"Mount target fsmt-id for file system fs-id\"' where 'fsmt-id' is the mount target ID, and 'fs-id' is the 'FileSystemId'.
--     -   Sets the 'requesterManaged' property of the network interface to \"true\", and the 'requesterId' value to \"EFS\".
--
--     Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding requestor-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is created, Amazon EFS sets the 'NetworkInterfaceId' field in the mount target\'s description to the network interface ID, and the 'IpAddress' field to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire 'CreateMountTarget' operation fails.
--
-- The 'CreateMountTarget' call returns only after creating the network interface, but while the mount target state is still \"creating\". You can check the mount target creation status by calling the < DescribeFileSystems> API, which among other things returns the mount target state.
--
-- We recommend you create a mount target in each of the Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another Availability Zone. For more information, go to <http://aws.amazon.com/efs/ Amazon EFS> product detail page. In addition, by always using a mount target local to the instance\'s Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial failure scenario; if the Availability Zone in which your mount target is created goes down, then you won\'t be able to access your file system through that mount target.
--
-- This operation requires permission for the following action on the file system:
--
-- -   'elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget'
--
-- This operation also requires permission for the following Amazon EC2 actions:
--
-- -   'ec2:DescribeSubnets'
-- -   'ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces'
-- -   'ec2:CreateNetworkInterface'
