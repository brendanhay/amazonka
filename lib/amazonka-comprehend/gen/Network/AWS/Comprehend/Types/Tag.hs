-- | A key-value pair that adds as a metadata to a resource used by Amazon Comprehend. For example, a tag with the key-value pair ‘Department’:’Sales’ might be added to a resource to indicate its use by a particular department.

-- /See:/ 'tag' smart constructor.

  deriving (Eq, Read, Show, Data, Typeable, Generic)

-- | Creates a value of 'Tag' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'tagValue' - The second part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the initial (key) portion of the pair, with a value of “sales” to indicate the sales department.
--
-- * 'tagKey' - The initial part of a key-value pair that forms a tag associated with a given resource. For instance, if you want to show which resources are used by which departments, you might use “Department” as the key portion of the pair, with multiple possible values such as “sales,” “legal,” and “administration.”
