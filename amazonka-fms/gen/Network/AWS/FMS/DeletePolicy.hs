    -- For AWS WAF and Shield Advanced policies, the cleanup does the

    --
    -- -   Deletes rule groups created by AWS Firewall Manager
    --
    -- -   Removes web ACLs from in-scope resources
    --
    -- -   Deletes web ACLs that contain no rules or rule groups

    -- For security group policies, the cleanup does the following for each
    -- security group in the policy:
    --
    -- -   Disassociates the security group from in-scope resources
    --
    -- -   Deletes the security group if it was created through Firewall
    --     Manager and if it\'s no longer associated with any resources through
    --     another policy
    --
    -- After the cleanup, in-scope resources are no longer protected by web
    -- ACLs in this policy. Protection of out-of-scope resources remains
    -- unchanged. Scope is determined by tags that you create and accounts that
    -- you associate with the policy. When creating the policy, if you specify
    -- that only resources in specific accounts or with specific tags are in
    -- scope of the policy, those accounts and resources are handled by the
    -- policy. All others are out of scope. If you don\'t specify tags or
