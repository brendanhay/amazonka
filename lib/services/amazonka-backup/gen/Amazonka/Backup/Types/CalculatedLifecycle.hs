-- | Contains @DeleteAt@ and @MoveToColdStorageAt@ timestamps, which are used
-- to specify a lifecycle for a recovery point.
--
-- The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
-- storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups
-- automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.
--
-- Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
-- a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “retention” setting must be 90 days
-- greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The
-- “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup
-- has been transitioned to cold.
--
-- Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage are
-- listed in the \"Lifecycle to cold storage\" section of the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html#features-by-resource Feature availability by resource>
-- table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.
