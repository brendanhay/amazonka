--
-- Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route. The
-- account owner of the service resource is always the environment owner,
-- regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service
-- in the application. If an application does not have any routes, then the
-- first route must be created as a @DEFAULT@ @RouteType@.
--
-- When created, the default route defaults to an active state so state is
-- not a required input. However, like all other state values the state of
-- the default route can be updated after creation, but only when all other
-- routes are also inactive. Conversely, no route can be active without the
-- default route also being active.
--
-- When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API
-- Gateway to send traffic to the target service as follows:
--
-- -   __URL Endpoints__
--
--     If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a
--     private IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic using the API
--     Gateway VPC link. If a service endpoint resolves to a public IP
--     address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the public internet.
--     Services can have HTTP or HTTPS URL endpoints. For HTTPS URLs,
--     publicly-signed certificates are supported. Private Certificate
--     Authorities (CAs) are permitted only if the CA\'s domain is also
--     publicly resolvable.
--
--     Refactor Spaces automatically resolves the public Domain Name System
--     (DNS) names that are set in @CreateService:UrlEndpoint @when you
--     create a service. The DNS names resolve when the DNS time-to-live
--     (TTL) expires, or every 60 seconds for TTLs less than 60 seconds.
--     This periodic DNS resolution ensures that the route configuration
--     remains up-to-date.
--
--     __One-time health check__
--
--     A one-time health check is performed on the service when either the
--     route is updated from inactive to active, or when it is created with
--     an active state. If the health check fails, the route transitions
--     the route state to @FAILED@, an error code of
--     @SERVICE_ENDPOINT_HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURE@ is provided, and no traffic
--     is sent to the service.
--
--     For private URLs, a target group is created on the Network Load
--     Balancer and the load balancer target group runs default target
--     health checks. By default, the health check is run against the
--     service endpoint URL. Optionally, the health check can be performed
--     against a different protocol, port, and\/or path using the
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub-refactor-spaces/latest/APIReference/API_CreateService.html#migrationhubrefactorspaces-CreateService-request-UrlEndpoint CreateService:UrlEndpoint>
--     parameter. All other health check settings for the load balancer use
--     the default values described in the
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html Health checks for your target groups>
--     in the /Elastic Load Balancing guide/. The health check is
--     considered successful if at least one target within the target group
--     transitions to a healthy state.
--
-- -   __Lambda function endpoints__
--
--     If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor Spaces
--     configures the Lambda function\'s resource policy to allow the
--     application\'s API Gateway to invoke the function.
--
--     The Lambda function state is checked. If the function is not active,
--     the function configuration is updated so that Lambda resources are
--     provisioned. If the Lambda state is @Failed@, then the route
--     creation fails. For more information, see the
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State GetFunctionConfiguration\'s State response parameter>
--     in the /Lambda Developer Guide/.
--
--     A check is performed to determine that a Lambda function with the
--     specified ARN exists. If it does not exist, the health check fails.
--     For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If
--     the URL is not reachable, the health check fails.
--
-- __Environments without a network bridge__
--
-- When you create environments without a network bridge
-- (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub-refactor-spaces/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEnvironment.html#migrationhubrefactorspaces-CreateEnvironment-request-NetworkFabricType CreateEnvironment:NetworkFabricType>
-- is @NONE)@ and you use your own networking infrastructure, you need to
-- configure
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/amazon-vpc-to-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.html VPC to VPC connectivity>
-- between your network and the application proxy VPC. Route creation from
-- the application proxy to service endpoints will fail if your network is
-- not configured to connect to the application proxy VPC. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub-refactor-spaces/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-role.html Create a route>
