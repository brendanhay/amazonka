## Description

Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It
provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses
Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your
infrastructure outside of AWS.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-route53)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
