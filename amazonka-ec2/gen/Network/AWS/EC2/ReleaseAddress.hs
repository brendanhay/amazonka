-- Releases the specified Elastic IP address.
--
-- [EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically
-- disassociates it from any instance that it\'s associated with. To
-- disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use
-- DisassociateAddress.
--
-- [Nondefault VPC] You must use DisassociateAddress to disassociate the
-- Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2
-- returns an error (@InvalidIPAddress.InUse@).
--
-- After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address
-- pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that
-- communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP
-- address that you already released, you\'ll get an @AuthFailure@ error if
-- the address is already allocated to another AWS account.
--
-- [EC2-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you
-- might be able to recover it. For more information, see AllocateAddress.
