-- | Describes an instances distribution for an Auto Scaling group with a
-- MixedInstancesPolicy.
--
-- The instances distribution specifies the distribution of On-Demand
-- Instances and Spot Instances, the maximum price to pay for Spot
-- Instances, and how the Auto Scaling group allocates instance types to
-- fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.
--
-- When you update @SpotAllocationStrategy@, @SpotInstancePools@, or
-- @SpotMaxPrice@, this update action does not deploy any changes across
-- the running Amazon EC2 instances in the group. Your existing Spot
-- Instances continue to run as long as the maximum price for those
-- instances is higher than the current Spot price. When scale out occurs,
-- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances based on the new settings.
-- When scale in occurs, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances
-- according to the group\'s termination policies.
--
-- /See:/ 'newInstancesDistribution' smart constructor.
