-- Deletes stored utterances.
--
--
-- Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot unless the @childDirected@ field in the bot is set to @true@ . Utterances are stored for 15 days for use with the 'GetUtterancesView' operation, and then stored indefinately for use in improving the ability of your bot to respond to user input.
--
-- Use the @DeleteStoredUtterances@ operation to manually delete stored utterances for a specific user.
--
-- This operation requires permissions for the @lex:DeleteUtterances@ action.
