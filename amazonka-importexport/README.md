## Version

`1.0.2`


## Description

AWS Import\/Export Service AWS Import\/Export accelerates transferring
large amounts of data between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices
that you mail to us. AWS Import\/Export transfers data directly onto and
off of your storage devices using Amazon\'s high-speed internal network
and bypassing the Internet. For large data sets, AWS Import\/Export is
often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than
upgrading your connectivity.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-importexport)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
