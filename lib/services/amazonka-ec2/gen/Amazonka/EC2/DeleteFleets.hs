-- Deletes the specified EC2 Fleets.
--
-- After you delete an EC2 Fleet, it launches no new instances.
--
-- You must also specify whether a deleted EC2 Fleet should terminate its
-- instances. If you choose to terminate the instances, the EC2 Fleet
-- enters the @deleted_terminating@ state. Otherwise, the EC2 Fleet enters
-- the @deleted_running@ state, and the instances continue to run until
-- they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.
--
-- For @instant@ fleets, EC2 Fleet must terminate the instances when the
-- fleet is deleted. A deleted @instant@ fleet with running instances is
-- not supported.
--
-- __Restrictions__
--
-- -   You can delete up to 25 @instant@ fleets in a single request. If you
--     exceed this number, no @instant@ fleets are deleted and an error is
--     returned. There is no restriction on the number of fleets of type
--     @maintain@ or @request@ that can be deleted in a single request.
--
-- -   Up to 1000 instances can be terminated in a single request to delete
--     @instant@ fleets.
--
