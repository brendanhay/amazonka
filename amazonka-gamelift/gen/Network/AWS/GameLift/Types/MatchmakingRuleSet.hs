-- | Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build
-- your player matches. Each rule set describes a type of group to be
-- created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule
-- sets are used in MatchmakingConfiguration objects.
--
-- A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed
-- information and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-rulesets.html Build a FlexMatch Rule Set>.
--
-- -   Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for
--     the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a
--     rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to
--     be filled.
--
-- -   Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of
--     player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match.
--     Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must
--     provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an
--     attribute might specify a player\'s skill or level.
--
-- -   Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players
--     for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum
--     requirements for individual players, teams, or entire matches. For
--     example, a rule might require each player to meet a certain skill
--     level, each team to have at least one player in a certain role, or
--     the match to have a minimum average skill level. or may describe an
--     entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at
--     least one player in a certain role.
--
-- -   Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules
--     after a period of time when no acceptable matches are found. This
--     feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable
--     amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best
--     possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase
--     the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.
