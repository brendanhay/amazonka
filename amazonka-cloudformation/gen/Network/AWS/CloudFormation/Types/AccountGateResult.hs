-- | Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which
-- AWS CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with a stack
-- set operation in an account and Region.
--
-- For each account and Region, AWS CloudFormation lets you specify a
-- Lamdba function that encapsulates any requirements that must be met
-- before CloudFormation can proceed with a stack set operation in that
-- account and Region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a
-- stack set operation is requested for that account and Region; if the
-- function returns @FAILED@, CloudFormation cancels the operation in that
-- account and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for
-- that account and Region to @FAILED@.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-account-gating.html Configuring a target account gate>.
