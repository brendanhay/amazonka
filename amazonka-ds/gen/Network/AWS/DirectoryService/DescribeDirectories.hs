-- Obtains information about the directories that belong to this account.
--
-- You can retrieve information about specific directories by passing the
-- directory identifiers in the @DirectoryIds@ parameter. Otherwise, all
-- directories that belong to the current account are returned.
--
-- This operation supports pagination with the use of the @NextToken@
-- request and response parameters. If more results are available, the
-- @DescribeDirectoriesResult.NextToken@ member contains a token that you
-- pass in the next call to DescribeDirectories to retrieve the next set of
-- items.
--
-- You can also specify a maximum number of return results with the @Limit@
-- parameter.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
