Event messaging includes the fleet ID.     * __FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING__ – Fleet status changed from @NEW@ to @DOWNLOADING@ . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.     * __FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED__ – The build failed to download to the fleet instance.     * __FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD__ – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/ .     * __FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER__ – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/ .      * __FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG__ – The build process was successful, and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/ .      * __FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING__ – Fleet status changed from @DOWNLOADING@ to @VALIDATING@ .     * __FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND__ – Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.     * __FLEET_STATE_BUILDING__ – Fleet status changed from @VALIDATING@ to @BUILDING@ .     * __FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE__ – Validation of the run-time configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.     * __FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING__ – Fleet status changed from @BUILDING@ to @ACTIVATING@ .      * __FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED__ - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process. A possible reason for failure is that the game server is not reporting "process ready" to the Amazon GameLift service.     * __FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE__ – The fleet's status changed from @ACTIVATING@ to @ACTIVE@ . The fleet is now ready to host game sessions.     * Other fleet events:     * __FLEET_SCALING_EVENT__ – A change was made to the fleet's capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity settings.     * __FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED__ – A change was made to the fleet's game session protection policy setting.

Amazon GameLift tries these destinations in an order based on either the queue's default order or player latency information, if provided in a placement request. With latency information, Amazon GameLift can place game sessions where the majority of players are reporting the lowest possible latency.

-- | Set of rule statements, used with FlexMatch, that determine how to build a certain kind of player match. Each rule set describes a type of group to be created and defines the parameters for acceptable player matches. Rule sets are used in 'MatchmakingConfiguration' objects.
--
--
-- A rule set may define the following elements for a match. For detailed information and examples showing how to construct a rule set, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-rules.html Create Matchmaking Rules for Your Game> .
--
--     * Teams -- Required. A rule set must define one or multiple teams for the match and set minimum and maximum team sizes. For example, a rule set might describe a 4x4 match that requires all eight slots to be filled.
--
--     * Player attributes -- Optional. These attributes specify a set of player characteristics to evaluate when looking for a match. Matchmaking requests that use a rule set with player attributes must provide the corresponding attribute values. For example, an attribute might specify a player's skill or level.
--
--     * Rules -- Optional. Rules define how to evaluate potential players for a match based on player attributes. A rule might specify minimum requirements for individual players--such as each player must meet a certain skill level, or may describe an entire group--such as all teams must be evenly matched or have at least one player in a certain role.
--
--     * Expansions -- Optional. Expansions allow you to relax the rules after a period of time if no acceptable matches are found. This feature lets you balance getting players into games in a reasonable amount of time instead of making them wait indefinitely for the best possible match. For example, you might use an expansion to increase the maximum skill variance between players after 30 seconds.

-- | A collection of server process configurations that describe what processes to run on each instance in a fleet. All fleets must have a run-time configuration. Each instance in the fleet launches the server processes specified in the run-time configuration and launches new ones as existing processes end. Each instance regularly checks for an updated run-time configuration and follows the new instructions.
--
--
-- The run-time configuration enables the instances in a fleet to run multiple processes simultaneously. Potential scenarios are as follows: (1) Run multiple processes of a single game server executable to maximize usage of your hosting resources. (2) Run one or more processes of different build executables, such as your game server executable and a related program, or two or more different versions of a game server. (3) Run multiple processes of a single game server but with different launch parameters, for example to run one process on each instance in debug mode.
--
-- A Amazon GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running simultaneously. A run-time configuration must specify fewer than this limit. To calculate the total number of processes specified in a run-time configuration, add the values of the @ConcurrentExecutions@ parameter for each @'ServerProcess' @ object in the run-time configuration.
