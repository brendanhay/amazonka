-- RunJobFlow creates and starts running a new cluster (job flow). The
-- cluster runs the steps specified. After the steps complete, the cluster
-- stops and the HDFS partition is lost. To prevent loss of data, configure
-- the last step of the job flow to store results in Amazon S3. If the
-- JobFlowInstancesConfig @KeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps@ parameter is set to
-- @TRUE@, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than
-- shutting down after the steps have completed.
--
-- For additional protection, you can set the JobFlowInstancesConfig
-- @TerminationProtected@ parameter to @TRUE@ to lock the cluster and
-- prevent it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in
-- the event of a job flow error.
--
-- A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow.
--
-- If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or
-- complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You
-- can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using the
-- SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly
-- to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For
-- more information on how to do this, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/AddMoreThan256Steps.html Add More than 256 Steps to a Cluster>
-- in the /Amazon EMR Management Guide/.
--
-- For long running clusters, we recommend that you periodically store your
-- results.
--
-- The instance fleets configuration is available only in Amazon EMR
-- versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. The RunJobFlow
-- request can contain InstanceFleets parameters or InstanceGroups
-- parameters, but not both.
