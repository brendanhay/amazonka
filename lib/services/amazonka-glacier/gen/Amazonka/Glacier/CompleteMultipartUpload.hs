--
-- You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all
-- the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble
-- the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the
-- archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created
-- archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive.
-- After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to
-- retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault
-- inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
-- information, see InitiateJob.
--
-- In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the
-- entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a
-- SHA256 tree hash, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html Computing Checksums>.
-- On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the
-- assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the
-- vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The
-- ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific
-- multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded
-- part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue.
--
-- Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when
-- assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier
-- returns an error and the operation fails.
--
-- Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first
-- successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again
-- within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same
-- archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue
-- that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in
-- which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get
-- the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however,
-- that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List
-- Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List
-- Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
