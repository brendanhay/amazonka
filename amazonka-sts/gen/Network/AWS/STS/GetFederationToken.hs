-- Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access
-- key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user.
-- A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security
-- credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate
-- network. Because you must call the 'GetFederationToken' action using the
-- long-term security credentials of an IAM user, this call is appropriate
-- in contexts where those credentials can be safely stored, usually in a
-- server-based application.
--
-- If you are creating a mobile-based or browser-based app that can
-- authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon,
-- Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider, we
-- recommend that you use <http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ Amazon Cognito>
-- or 'AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity'. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/CreatingWIF.html Creating Temporary Security Credentials for Mobile Apps Using Identity Providers>.
--
-- The 'GetFederationToken' action must be called by using the long-term
-- AWS security credentials of an IAM user. You can also call
-- 'GetFederationToken' using the security credentials of an AWS account
-- (root), but this is not recommended. Instead, we recommend that you
-- create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then
-- attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the
-- actions and resources they need access to. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html IAM Best Practices>
-- in /Using IAM/.
--
-- The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the
-- long-term credentials of an IAM user are valid for the specified
-- duration, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 129600 seconds (36
-- hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account
-- (root) credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour)
--
-- __Permissions__
--
-- The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by
-- 'GetFederationToken' are determined by a combination of the following:
--
-- -   The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose
--     credentials are used to call 'GetFederationToken'.
-- -   The policy that is passed as a parameter in the call.
--
-- The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that
-- result from the 'GetFederationToken' API call--that is, to the
-- /federated user/. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS
-- evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with
-- the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were
-- used to call 'GetFederationToken'. AWS allows the federated user\'s
-- request only when both the federated user /__and__/ the IAM user are
-- explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy
-- cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM
-- user policy.
--
-- A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose
-- credentials are used to call 'GetFederationToken' are designed to allow
-- access to all the actions and resources that any federated user will
-- need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation
-- that scopes down the permissions to a level that\'s appropriate to that
-- individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions
-- that are granted to the IAM user.
--
-- If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security
-- credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when
-- the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that
-- has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated user
-- to access the resource.

-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/permissions-get-federation-token.html Permissions for GetFederationToken>.

-- security credentials, see

-- | An IAM policy in JSON format that is passed with the

-- permissions that are available to the IAM user, by allowing only a
-- subset of the permissions that are granted to the IAM user. The passed
-- policy cannot grant more permissions than those granted to the IAM user.
-- The final permissions for the federated user are the most restrictive
-- set based on the intersection of the passed policy and the IAM user
-- policy.
--
-- If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security

-- percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100%
