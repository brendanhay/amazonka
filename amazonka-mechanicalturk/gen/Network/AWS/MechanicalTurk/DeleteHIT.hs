--
-- The @DeleteHIT@ operation is used to delete HIT that is no longer
-- needed. Only the Requester who created the HIT can delete it.
--
-- You can only dispose of HITs that are in the @Reviewable@ state, with
-- all of their submitted assignments already either approved or rejected.
-- If you call the DeleteHIT operation on a HIT that is not in the
-- @Reviewable@ state (for example, that has not expired, or still has
-- active assignments), or on a HIT that is Reviewable but without all of
-- its submitted assignments already approved or rejected, the service will
-- return an error.
--
-- -   HITs are automatically disposed of after 120 days.
--
-- -   After you dispose of a HIT, you can no longer approve the HIT\'s
--     rejected assignments.
--
-- -   Disposed HITs are not returned in results for the ListHITs
--     operation.
--
-- -   Disposing HITs can improve the performance of operations such as
--     ListReviewableHITs and ListHITs.
