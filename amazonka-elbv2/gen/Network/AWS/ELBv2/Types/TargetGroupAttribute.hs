data TargetGroupAttribute = TargetGroupAttribute'
  { -- | The name of the attribute.
    --
    -- The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:
    --
    -- -   @deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds@ - The amount of time, in
    --     seconds, for Elastic Load Balancing to wait before changing the
    --     state of a deregistering target from @draining@ to @unused@. The
    --     range is 0-3600 seconds. The default value is 300 seconds. If the
    --     target is a Lambda function, this attribute is not supported.
    --
    -- The following attributes are supported by both Application Load
    -- Balancers and Network Load Balancers:
    --
    -- -   @stickiness.enabled@ - Indicates whether sticky sessions are
    --     enabled. The value is @true@ or @false@. The default is @false@.
    --
    -- -   @stickiness.type@ - The type of sticky sessions. The possible values
    --     are @lb_cookie@ and @app_cookie@ for Application Load Balancers or
    --     @source_ip@ for Network Load Balancers.
    --
    -- The following attributes are supported only if the load balancer is an
    -- Application Load Balancer and the target is an instance or an IP
    -- address:
    --
    -- -   @load_balancing.algorithm.type@ - The load balancing algorithm
    --     determines how the load balancer selects targets when routing
    --     requests. The value is @round_robin@ or
    --     @least_outstanding_requests@. The default is @round_robin@.
    --
    -- -   @slow_start.duration_seconds@ - The time period, in seconds, during
    --     which a newly registered target receives an increasing share of the
    --     traffic to the target group. After this time period ends, the target
    --     receives its full share of traffic. The range is 30-900 seconds (15
    --     minutes). The default is 0 seconds (disabled).
    --
    -- -   @stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name@ - Indicates the name of the
    --     application-based cookie. Names that start with the following names
    --     are not allowed: @AWSALB@, @AWSALBAPP@, and @AWSALBTG@. They\'re
    --     reserved for use by the load balancer.
    --
    -- -   @stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds@ - The time period, in
    --     seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the
    --     same target. After this time period expires, the application-based
    --     cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second to 1 week (604800
    --     seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400 seconds).
    --
    -- -   @stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds@ - The time period, in
    --     seconds, during which requests from a client should be routed to the
    --     same target. After this time period expires, the load
    --     balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The range is 1 second
    --     to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default value is 1 day (86400
    --     seconds).
    --
    -- The following attribute is supported only if the load balancer is an
    -- Application Load Balancer and the target is a Lambda function:
    --
    -- -   @lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled@ - Indicates whether the request
    --     and response headers that are exchanged between the load balancer
    --     and the Lambda function include arrays of values or strings. The
    --     value is @true@ or @false@. The default is @false@. If the value is
    --     @false@ and the request contains a duplicate header field name or
    --     query parameter key, the load balancer uses the last value sent by
    --     the client.
    --
    -- The following attributes are supported only by Network Load Balancers:
    --
    -- -   @deregistration_delay.connection_termination.enabled@ - Indicates
    --     whether the load balancer terminates connections at the end of the
    --     deregistration timeout. The value is @true@ or @false@. The default
    --     is @false@.
    --
    -- -   @preserve_client_ip.enabled@ - Indicates whether client IP
    --     preservation is enabled. The value is @true@ or @false@. The default
    --     is disabled if the target group type is IP address and the target
    --     group protocol is TCP or TLS. Otherwise, the default is enabled.
    --     Client IP preservation cannot be disabled for UDP and TCP_UDP target
    --     groups.
    --
    -- -   @proxy_protocol_v2.enabled@ - Indicates whether Proxy Protocol
    --     version 2 is enabled. The value is @true@ or @false@. The default is
    --     @false@.
