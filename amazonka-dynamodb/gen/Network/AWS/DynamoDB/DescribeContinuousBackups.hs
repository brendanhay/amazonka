-- Checks the status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on
-- the specified table. Continuous backups are @ENABLED@ on all tables at
-- table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled,
-- @PointInTimeRecoveryStatus@ will be set to ENABLED.
--
-- After continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can
-- restore to any point in time within @EarliestRestorableDateTime@ and
-- @LatestRestorableDateTime@.
--
-- @LatestRestorableDateTime@ is typically 5 minutes before the current
-- time. You can restore your table to any point in time during the last 35
-- days.
--
-- You can call @DescribeContinuousBackups@ at a maximum rate of 10 times
-- per second.
