    AWS CloudFormation

    AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
    deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you
    leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto
    Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective
    applications without worrying about creating and configuring the
    underlying AWS infrastructure.

    With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and
    dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of
    resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates
    and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all
    dependencies between the resources for you.

    For more information about this product, go to the
    <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ CloudFormation Product Page>.

    Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need
    additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can
    find the product\'s technical documentation at
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
