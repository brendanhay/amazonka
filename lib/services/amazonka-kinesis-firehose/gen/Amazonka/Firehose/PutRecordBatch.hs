-- Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call,
-- which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing
-- single records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use
-- PutRecord. Applications using these operations are referred to as
-- producers.
--
-- For information about service quota, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota>.
--
-- Each PutRecordBatch request supports up to 500 records. Each record in
-- the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before base64 encoding), up to
-- a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.
--
-- You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record
-- when using PutRecord. The data record consists of a data blob that can
-- be up to 1,000 KB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it could
-- be a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website
-- clickstream data, and so on.
--
-- Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the
-- destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common
-- solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (@\\n@) or
-- some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer
-- application to parse individual data items when reading the data from
-- the destination.
--
-- The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records,
-- @FailedPutCount@, and an array of responses, @RequestResponses@. Even if
-- the PutRecordBatch call succeeds, the value of @FailedPutCount@ may be
-- greater than 0, indicating that there are records for which the
-- operation didn\'t succeed. Each entry in the @RequestResponses@ array
-- provides additional information about the processed record. It directly
-- correlates with a record in the request array using the same ordering,
-- from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same
-- number of records as the request array. @RequestResponses@ includes both
-- successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Firehose
-- tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single
-- record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.
--
-- A successfully processed record includes a @RecordId@ value, which is
-- unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes
-- @ErrorCode@ and @ErrorMessage@ values. @ErrorCode@ reflects the type of
-- error, and is one of the following values: @ServiceUnavailableException@
-- or @InternalFailure@. @ErrorMessage@ provides more detailed information
-- about the error.
--
-- If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have
-- completed or it might have failed. If @FailedPutCount@ is greater than
-- 0, retry the request, resending only those records that might have
-- failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and
-- also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We
-- recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.
--
-- If PutRecordBatch throws @ServiceUnavailableException@, back off and
-- retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput
-- limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream.
--
-- Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from
-- the time they are added to a delivery stream as it attempts to send the
-- records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more
-- than 24 hours, the data is no longer available.
--
-- Don\'t concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of
-- your records. Instead, concatenate the raw data, then perform base64
-- encoding.
