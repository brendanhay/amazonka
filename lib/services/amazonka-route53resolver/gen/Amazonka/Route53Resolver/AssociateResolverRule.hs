-- Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a
-- VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is
-- specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are
-- forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified
-- in the rule. For more information about rules, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html CreateResolverRule>.
