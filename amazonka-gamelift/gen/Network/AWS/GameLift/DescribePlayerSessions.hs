-- Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions. This action can be used in several ways: (1) provide a @PlayerSessionId@ to request properties for a specific player session; (2) provide a @GameSessionId@ to request properties for all player sessions in the specified game session; (3) provide a @PlayerId@ to request properties for all player sessions of a specified player.
--
--
-- To get game session record(s), specify only one of the following: a player session ID, a game session ID, or a player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a 'PlayerSession' object is returned for each session matching the request.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribePlayerSessions' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dpssGameSessionId' - Unique identifier for the game session to retrieve player sessions for.
--
-- * 'dpssNextToken' - Token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify a value. If a player session ID is specified, this parameter is ignored.
--
-- * 'dpssLimit' - Maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with @NextToken@ to get results as a set of sequential pages. If a player session ID is specified, this parameter is ignored.
--
-- * 'dpssPlayerSessionId' - Unique identifier for a player session to retrieve.
--
-- * 'dpssPlayerId' - Unique identifier for a player to retrieve player sessions for.
--
-- * 'dpssPlayerSessionStatusFilter' - Player session status to filter results on. Possible player session statuses include the following:     * __RESERVED__ – The player session request has been received, but the player has not yet connected to the server process and/or been validated.      * __ACTIVE__ – The player has been validated by the server process and is currently connected.     * __COMPLETED__ – The player connection has been dropped.     * __TIMEDOUT__ – A player session request was received, but the player did not connect and/or was not validated within the time-out limit (60 seconds).
