-- | High-level information for a managed rule set.

-- Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
-- rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your
-- customers. The APIs are @ListManagedRuleSets@, @GetManagedRuleSet@,
-- @PutManagedRuleSetVersions@, and
-- @UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate@.
