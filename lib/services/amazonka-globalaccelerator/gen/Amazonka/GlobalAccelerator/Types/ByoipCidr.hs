-- | Information about an IP address range that is provisioned for use with

--
-- -   __PENDING_PROVISIONING__ — You’ve submitted a request to provision

--     Accelerator.
--
-- -   __READY__ — The address range is provisioned with Global Accelerator
--     and can be advertised.
--
-- -   __PENDING_ADVERTISING__ — You’ve submitted a request for Global
--     Accelerator to advertise an address range but it is not yet being
--     advertised.
--
-- -   __ADVERTISING__ — The address range is being advertised by Global
--     Accelerator.
--
-- -   __PENDING_WITHDRAWING__ — You’ve submitted a request to withdraw an
--     address range from being advertised but it is still being advertised
--     by Global Accelerator.
--
-- -   __PENDING_DEPROVISIONING__ — You’ve submitted a request to
--     deprovision an address range from Global Accelerator but it is still
--     provisioned.
--
-- -   __DEPROVISIONED__ — The address range is deprovisioned from Global
--     Accelerator.
--
-- -   __FAILED_PROVISION__ — The request to provision the address range
--     from Global Accelerator was not successful. Please make sure that
--     you provide all of the correct information, and try again. If the
