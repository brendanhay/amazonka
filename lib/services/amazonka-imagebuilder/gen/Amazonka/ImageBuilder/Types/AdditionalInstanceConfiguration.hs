-- | In addition to your infrastructure configuration, these settings provide
-- an extra layer of control over your build instances. You can also
-- specify commands to run on launch for all of your build instances.
--
-- Image Builder does not automatically install the Systems Manager agent
-- on Windows instances. If your base image includes the Systems Manager
-- agent, then the AMI that you create will also include the agent. For
-- Linux instances, if the base image does not already include the Systems
-- Manager agent, Image Builder installs it. For Linux instances where
-- Image Builder installs the Systems Manager agent, you can choose whether
-- to keep it for the AMI that you create.

    -- The userDataOverride property replaces any commands that Image Builder
