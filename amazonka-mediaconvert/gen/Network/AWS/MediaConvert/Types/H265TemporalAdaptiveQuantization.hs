-- | Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within
-- each frame based on temporal variation of content complexity. When you
-- enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame
-- that aren\'t moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp
-- edges that move a lot. For example, this feature improves the
-- readability of text tickers on newscasts and scoreboards on sports
-- matches. Enabling this feature will almost always improve your video
-- quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn\'t take into account
-- where the viewer\'s attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to
-- be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn\'t have
-- moving objects with sharp edges, such as sports athletes\' faces, you
-- might choose to disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable
-- temporal quantization, adjust the strength of the filter with the
-- setting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).
