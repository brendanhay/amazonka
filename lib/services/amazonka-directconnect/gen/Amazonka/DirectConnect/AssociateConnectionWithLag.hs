-- Associates an existing connection with a link aggregation group (LAG).
-- The connection is interrupted and re-established as a member of the LAG
-- (connectivity to Amazon Web Services is interrupted). The connection
-- must be hosted on the same Direct Connect endpoint as the LAG, and its
-- bandwidth must match the bandwidth for the LAG. You can re-associate a
-- connection that\'s currently associated with a different LAG; however,
-- if removing the connection would cause the original LAG to fall below
-- its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request
-- fails.
--
-- Any virtual interfaces that are directly associated with the connection
-- are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the connection was
-- originally associated with a different LAG, the virtual interfaces
-- remain associated with the original LAG.
--
-- For interconnects, any hosted connections are automatically
-- re-associated with the LAG. If the interconnect was originally
-- associated with a different LAG, the hosted connections remain
-- associated with the original LAG.
