    -- Valid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful
    -- @statistics@ to include in your request, and the published @unit@ value.
    --
    -- -   __@BurstCapacityPercentage@__ - The percentage of CPU performance
    --     available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your
    --     instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst
    --     capacity stops accruing when your instance\'s
    --     @BurstCapacityPercentage@ reaches 100%. For more information, see
    --     <https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail>.
    --
    --     @Statistics@: The most useful statistics are @Maximum@ and
    --     @Average@.
    --
    --     @Unit@: The published unit is @Percent@.
    --
    -- -   __@BurstCapacityTime@__ - The available amount of time for your
    --     instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance
    --     continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity
    --     time stops accruing when your instance\'s @BurstCapacityPercentage@
    --     metric reaches 100%.
    --
    --     Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your
    --     instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your
    --     instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a
    --     5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a
    --     50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30
    --     seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For
    --     more information, see

    --
    -- -   __@CPUUtilization@__ - The percentage of allocated compute units
    --     that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies
    --     the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools
    --     in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail
    --     when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.

    --     @Unit@: The published unit is @Percent@.
    --
    -- -   __@NetworkIn@__ - The number of bytes received on all network
    --     interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of
    --     incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the
    --     number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is
    --     reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to
    --     find Bytes\/second.

    --     interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of
    --     outgoing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is
    --     the number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is
    --     reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to
    --     find Bytes\/second.

    --     failed both the instance status check and the system status check.
    --     This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data
    --     is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.

    --     passed or failed the instance status check. This metric can be
    --     either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in
    --     1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.

    --
    -- -   __@MetadataNoToken@__ - Reports the number of times that the
    --     instance metadata service was successfully accessed without a token.
    --     This metric determines if there are any processes accessing instance
    --     metadata by using Instance Metadata Service Version 1, which
    --     doesn\'t use a token. If all requests use token-backed sessions,
    --     such as Instance Metadata Service Version 2, then the value is 0.

-- | The statistic for the metric.
--
-- The following statistics are available:
--
-- -   @Minimum@ - The lowest value observed during the specified period.
--     Use this value to determine low volumes of activity for your
--     application.
--
-- -   @Maximum@ - The highest value observed during the specified period.
--     Use this value to determine high volumes of activity for your
--     application.
--
-- -   @Sum@ - All values submitted for the matching metric added together.
--     You can use this statistic to determine the total volume of a
--     metric.
--
-- -   @Average@ - The value of Sum \/ SampleCount during the specified
--     period. By comparing this statistic with the Minimum and Maximum
--     values, you can determine the full scope of a metric and how close
--     the average use is to the Minimum and Maximum values. This
--     comparison helps you to know when to increase or decrease your
--     resources.
--
-- -   @SampleCount@ - The count, or number, of data points used for the
--     statistical calculation.
