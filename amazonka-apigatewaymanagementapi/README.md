## Version

`1.6.1`


## Description

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-apigatewaymanagementapi)
and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests,
and receiving responses.

Lenses are used for constructing and manipulating types,
due to the depth of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

See [Network.AWS.APIGatewayManagementAPI](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-apigatewaymanagementapi/docs/Network-AWS-APIGatewayManagementAPI.html)
or [the AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/) to get started.
