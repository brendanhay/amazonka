-- | Specifies a limit to how long a model training or compilation job can
-- run. It also specifies how long you are willing to wait for a managed
-- spot training job to complete. When the job reaches the time limit,
-- Amazon SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to
-- cap model training costs.
--
-- To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the @SIGTERM@
-- signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use
-- this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of
-- training are not lost.
--
-- The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save
-- the intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This
-- attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not
-- be in a state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has
-- just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this
-- intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a
-- model with @CreateModel@.
--
-- The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving
-- intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the
-- maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete.
