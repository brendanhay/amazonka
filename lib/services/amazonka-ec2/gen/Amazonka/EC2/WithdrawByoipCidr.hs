-- Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address

--
-- You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if
-- you specify different address ranges each time.
--
-- It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses
-- stops routing to Amazon Web Services because of BGP propagation delays.
