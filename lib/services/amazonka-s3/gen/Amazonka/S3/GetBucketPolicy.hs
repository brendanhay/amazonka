-- Returns the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
-- other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
-- the bucket, the calling identity must have the @GetBucketPolicy@
-- permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner\'s
-- account in order to use this operation.
--
-- If you don\'t have @GetBucketPolicy@ permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
-- @403 Access Denied@ error. If you have the correct permissions, but
-- you\'re not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner\'s
-- account, Amazon S3 returns a @405 Method Not Allowed@ error.
--
-- To ensure that bucket owners don\'t inadvertently lock themselves out of
-- their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner\'s Amazon Web
-- Services account can perform the @GetBucketPolicy@, @PutBucketPolicy@,
-- and @DeleteBucketPolicy@ API actions, even if their bucket policy
-- explicitly denies the root principal\'s access. Bucket owner root
-- principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC
-- endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.
--
-- To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias of
-- the access point in place of the bucket name.
--
-- To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, provide
-- the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name.
-- If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the
-- error code @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@ is returned. For more
-- information about @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList List of Error Codes>.
