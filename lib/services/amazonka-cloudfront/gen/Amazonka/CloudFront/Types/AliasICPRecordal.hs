-- | Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an
-- Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content
-- publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that
-- they\'ve added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal
-- status for CNAMEs associated with distributions. The status is returned
-- in the CloudFront response; you can\'t configure it yourself.
--
-- For more information about ICP recordals, see
