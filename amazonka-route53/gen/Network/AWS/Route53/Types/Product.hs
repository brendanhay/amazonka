(An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one EC2 instance.) If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any. If the environment contains a single EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.     * If you specify an ELB load balancer in @'AliasTarget' @ , ELB routes queries only to the healthy EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If no EC2 instances are healthy or if the load balancer itself is unhealthy, and if @EvaluateTargetHealth@ is true for the corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other resources. When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for ELB health checks; they're not Amazon Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function.

If you don't specify a value for @IPAddress@ , Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ at the interval that you specify in @RequestInterval@ . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of @IPAddress@ :      * __IPv4 address__ : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, @192.0.2.44@ .     * __IPv6 address__ : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, @2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345@ . You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, @2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345@ . If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for @IPAddress@ . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change. For more information, see 'HealthCheckConfig$FullyQualifiedDomainName' . Constraints: Amazon Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:     * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5735 RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses>      * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598 RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space>      * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156 RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses>  When the value of @Type@ is @CALCULATED@ or @CLOUDWATCH_METRIC@ , omit @IPAddress@ .
--
-- * 'hccEnableSNI' - Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ to the endpoint in the @client_hello@ message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to @HTTPS@ health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate. Some endpoints require that @HTTPS@ requests include the host name in the @client_hello@ message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be @SSL alert handshake_failure@ . A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the @Common Name@ field and possibly several more in the @Subject Alternative Names@ field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ . If the endpoint responds to the @client_hello@ message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ from the @client_hello@ message.
--
-- * 'hccSearchString' - If the value of Type is @HTTP_STR_MATCH@ or @HTTP_STR_MATCH@ , the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response body from the specified resource. If the string appears in the response body, Amazon Route 53 considers the resource healthy. Amazon Route 53 considers case when searching for @SearchString@ in the response body.
--
-- * 'hccHealthThreshold' - The number of child health checks that are associated with a @CALCULATED@ health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the @CALCULATED@ health check to be considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a @CALCULATED@ health check, use the 'HealthCheckConfig$ChildHealthChecks' and 'HealthCheckConfig$ChildHealthChecks' elements. Note the following:     * If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Amazon Route 53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.     * If you specify @0@ , Amazon Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.
--
-- * 'hccRegions' - A complex type that contains one @Region@ element for each region from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified endpoint. If you don't specify any regions, Amazon Route 53 health checkers automatically performs checks from all of the regions that are listed under __Valid Values__ . If you update a health check to remove a region that has been performing health checks, Amazon Route 53 will briefly continue to perform checks from that region to ensure that some health checkers are always checking the endpoint (for example, if you replace three regions with four different regions).
--
-- * 'hccResourcePath' - The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request when performing health checks. The path can be any value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for example, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html.
--
-- * 'hccInsufficientDataHealthStatus' - When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to determine the alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to the health check:     * @Healthy@ : Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.     * @Unhealthy@ : Amazon Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.     * @LastKnownStatus@ : Amazon Route 53 uses the status of the health check from the last time that CloudWatch had sufficient data to determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last known status, the default status for the health check is healthy.
--
-- * 'hccAlarmIdentifier' - A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether this health check is healthy.
--
-- * 'hccMeasureLatency' - Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the latency between health checkers in multiple AWS regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency graphs on the __Health Checks__ page in the Amazon Route 53 console. /Important:/ You can't change the value of @MeasureLatency@ after you create a health check.
--
-- * 'hccInverted' - Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a health check, for example, to consider a health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.
--
-- * 'hccFullyQualifiedDomainName' - Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for @IPAddress@ . __If you specify a value for__ @IPAddress@ : Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ in the @Host@ header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the @Host@ header:     * If you specify a value of @80@ for @Port@ and @HTTP@ or @HTTP_STR_MATCH@ for @Type@ , Amazon Route 53 passes the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ to the endpoint in the Host header.      * If you specify a value of @443@ for @Port@ and @HTTPS@ or @HTTPS_STR_MATCH@ for @Type@ , Amazon Route 53 passes the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ to the endpoint in the @Host@ header.     * If you specify another value for @Port@ and any value except @TCP@ for @Type@ , Amazon Route 53 passes @FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port@ to the endpoint in the @Host@ header. If you don't specify a value for @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of @IPAddress@ in the @Host@ header in each of the preceding cases. __If you don't specify a value for @IPAddress@ __ : Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ at the interval that you specify for @RequestInterval@ . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com). /Important:/ In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable. In addition, if the value that you specify for @Type@ is @HTTP@ , @HTTPS@ , @HTTP_STR_MATCH@ , or @HTTPS_STR_MATCH@ , Amazon Route 53 passes the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ in the @Host@ header, as it does when you specify a value for @IPAddress@ . If the value of @Type@ is @TCP@ , Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a @Host@ header.
--
-- * 'hccChildHealthChecks' - (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one @ChildHealthCheck@ element for each health check that you want to associate with a @CALCULATED@ health check.
--
-- * 'hccRequestInterval' - The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Amazon Route 53 health checker makes requests at this interval. /Important:/ You can't change the value of @RequestInterval@ after you create a health check. If you don't specify a value for @RequestInterval@ , the default value is @30@ seconds.
--
-- * 'hccPort' - The port on the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. Specify a value for @Port@ only when you specify a value for @IPAddress@ .
--
-- * 'hccType' - The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy. /Important:/ You can't change the value of @Type@ after you create a health check. You can create the following types of health checks:     * __HTTP__ : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.     * __HTTPS__ : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400. /Important:/ If you specify @HTTPS@ for the value of @Type@ , the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.     * __HTTP_STR_MATCH__ : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in @SearchString@ .     * __HTTPS_STR_MATCH__ : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an @HTTPS@ request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in @SearchString@ .     * __TCP__ : Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.     * __CLOUDWATCH_METRIC__ : The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is @OK@ , the health check is considered healthy. If the state is @ALARM@ , the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state is @OK@ or @ALARM@ , the health check status depends on the setting for @InsufficientDataHealthStatus@ : @Healthy@ , @Unhealthy@ , or @LastKnownStatus@ .      * __CALCULATED__ : For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Amazon Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Amazon Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of @HealthThreshold@ .  For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ .

--
-- * 'rrsTTL' - The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the following:     * If you're creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit @TTL@ . Amazon Route 53 uses the value of @TTL@ for the alias target.      * If you're associating this resource record set with a health check (if you're adding a @HealthCheckId@ element), we recommend that you specify a @TTL@ of 60 seconds or less so clients respond quickly to changes in health status.     * All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource record sets must have the same value for @TTL@ .     * If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more weighted alias resource record sets for which the alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify a @TTL@ of 60 seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you specify for @Weight@ .
--
-- * 'rrsResourceRecords' - Information about the resource records to act upon.
--
-- * 'rrsAliasTarget' - /Alias resource record sets only:/ Information about the CloudFront distribution, AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, ELB load balancer, Amazon S3 bucket, or Amazon Route 53 resource record set to which you're redirecting queries. The AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment must have a regionalized subdomain. If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted zone, note the following:     * You can't create alias resource record sets for CloudFront distributions in a private hosted zone.     * Creating geolocation alias resource record sets or latency alias resource record sets in a private hosted zone is unsupported.     * For information about creating failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'rrsWeight' - /Weighted resource record sets only:/ Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Amazon Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:     * You must specify a value for the @Weight@ element for every weighted resource record set.     * You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per weighted resource record set.     * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as weighted resource record sets.     * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.     * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting @Weight@ to @0@ is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html Options for Configuring Amazon Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'rrsTrafficPolicyInstanceId' - When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically creates a resource record set. @TrafficPolicyInstanceId@ is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 created this resource record set for. /Important:/ To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic policy instance, use @DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance@ . Amazon Route 53 will delete the resource record set automatically. If you delete the resource record set by using @ChangeResourceRecordSets@ , Amazon Route 53 doesn't automatically delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll continue to be charged for it even though it's no longer in use.
--
-- * 'rrsSetIdentifier' - /Weighted, Latency, Geo, and Failover resource record sets only:/ An identifier that differentiates among multiple resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. The value of @SetIdentifier@ must be unique for each resource record set that has the same combination of DNS name and type. Omit @SetIdentifier@ for any other types of record sets.
--
-- * 'rrsFailover' - /Failover resource record sets only:/ To configure failover, you add the @Failover@ element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify @PRIMARY@ as the value for @Failover@ ; for the other resource record set, you specify @SECONDARY@ . In addition, you include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set. Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the @HealthCheckId@ element in both resource record sets:     * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.     * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.     * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.     * If you omit the @HealthCheckId@ element for the secondary resource record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint. You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as failover resource record sets. For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the @EvaluateTargetHealth@ element and set the value to true. For more information about configuring failover for Amazon Route 53, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ :      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover>      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone>
--
-- * 'rrsHealthCheckId' - If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the ID of the applicable health check. Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:     * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check     * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)     * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks) For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy> . The @HealthCheckId@ element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:     * You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.     * You set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. /Important:/ Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the @Value@ element. When you add a @HealthCheckId@ element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.  For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of @CountryCode@ is @*@ ), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each @HTTP@ server that is serving content for @www.example.com@ . For the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , specify the domain name of the server (such as @us-east-2-www.example.com@ ), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com). /Important:/ n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable. For more information, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ :     * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover>      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone>
--
-- * 'rrsRegion' - /Latency-based resource record sets only:/ The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have created latency resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Amazon Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set. Note the following:     * You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per latency resource record set.     * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.     * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Amazon Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency resource record sets for.     * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as latency resource record sets.
--
-- * 'rrsGeoLocation' - /Geo location resource record sets only:/ A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of @192.0.2.111@ , create a resource record set with a @Type@ of @A@ and a @ContinentCode@ of @AF@ . If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value @*@ in the @CountryCode@ element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements. /Important:/ Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of @CountryCode@ is @*@ , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a @*@ resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations. You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as geolocation resource record sets.
--
-- * 'rrsMultiValueAnswer' - /Multivalue answer resource record sets only/ : To route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify @true@ for @MultiValueAnswer@ . Note the following:     * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.     * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Amazon Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.     * Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Amazon Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.     * If you have more than eight healthy records, Amazon Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.     * When all records are unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.     * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response. You can't create multivalue answer alias records.
--
-- * 'rrsName' - The name of the domain you want to perform the action on. Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, @www.example.com@ . You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 still assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Amazon Route 53 treats @www.example.com@ (without a trailing dot) and @www.example.com.@ (with a trailing dot) as identical. For information about how to specify characters other than @a-z@ , @0-9@ , and @-@ (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html DNS Domain Name Format> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ . You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, @*.example.com@ . Note the following:     * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify @*prod.example.com@ or @prod*.example.com@ .     * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.     * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard. /Important:/ You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS. You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, @*.example.com@ . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example, @marketing.*.example.com@ . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example, you can't specify @prod*.example.com@ .
--
-- * 'rrsType' - The DNS record type.

-- | /Weighted resource record sets only:/ Among resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the current resource record set. Amazon Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:     * You must specify a value for the @Weight@ element for every weighted resource record set.     * You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per weighted resource record set.     * You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as weighted resource record sets.     * You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.     * For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting @Weight@ to @0@ is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

rrsSetIdentifier :: Lens' ResourceRecordSet (Maybe Text)
rrsSetIdentifier = lens _rrsSetIdentifier (\ s a -> s{_rrsSetIdentifier = a});

-- | /Failover resource record sets only:/ To configure failover, you add the @Failover@ element to two resource record sets. For one resource record set, you specify @PRIMARY@ as the value for @Failover@ ; for the other resource record set, you specify @SECONDARY@ . In addition, you include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set. Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the @HealthCheckId@ element in both resource record sets:     * When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.     * When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.     * When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.     * If you omit the @HealthCheckId@ element for the secondary resource record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint. You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as failover resource record sets. For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the @EvaluateTargetHealth@ element and set the value to true. For more information about configuring failover for Amazon Route 53, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ :      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover>      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone>

rrsFailover = lens _rrsFailover (\ s a -> s{_rrsFailover = a});

-- | If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the ID of the applicable health check. Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:     * By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check     * By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)     * By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks) For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy> . The @HealthCheckId@ element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:     * You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.     * You set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. /Important:/ Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the @Value@ element. When you add a @HealthCheckId@ element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.  For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of @CountryCode@ is @*@ ), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each @HTTP@ server that is serving content for @www.example.com@ . For the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ , specify the domain name of the server (such as @us-east-2-www.example.com@ ), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com). /Important:/ n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable. For more information, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ :     * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover>      * <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone>

rrsHealthCheckId = lens _rrsHealthCheckId (\ s a -> s{_rrsHealthCheckId = a});

-- | /Latency-based resource record sets only:/ The Amazon EC2 Region where you created the resource that this resource record set refers to. The resource typically is an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name, depending on the record type. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have created latency resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Amazon Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set. Note the following:     * You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per latency resource record set.     * You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.     * You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Amazon Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions that you create latency resource record sets for.     * You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as latency resource record sets.
rrsRegion :: Lens' ResourceRecordSet (Maybe Region)
rrsRegion = lens _rrsRegion (\ s a -> s{_rrsRegion = a});

-- | /Geo location resource record sets only:/ A complex type that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of @192.0.2.111@ , create a resource record set with a @Type@ of @A@ and a @ContinentCode@ of @AF@ . If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value @*@ in the @CountryCode@ element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements. /Important:/ Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of @CountryCode@ is @*@ , which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a @*@ resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations. You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as geolocation resource record sets.
rrsGeoLocation :: Lens' ResourceRecordSet (Maybe GeoLocation)
rrsGeoLocation = lens _rrsGeoLocation (\ s a -> s{_rrsGeoLocation = a});

-- | /Multivalue answer resource record sets only/ : To route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify @true@ for @MultiValueAnswer@ . Note the following:     * If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.     * If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Amazon Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.     * Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Amazon Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.     * If you have more than eight healthy records, Amazon Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.     * When all records are unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.     * If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response. You can't create multivalue answer alias records.
rrsMultiValueAnswer :: Lens' ResourceRecordSet (Maybe Bool)
rrsMultiValueAnswer = lens _rrsMultiValueAnswer (\ s a -> s{_rrsMultiValueAnswer = a});

-- | The name of the domain you want to perform the action on. Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, @www.example.com@ . You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 still assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Amazon Route 53 treats @www.example.com@ (without a trailing dot) and @www.example.com.@ (with a trailing dot) as identical. For information about how to specify characters other than @a-z@ , @0-9@ , and @-@ (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html DNS Domain Name Format> in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ . You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, @*.example.com@ . Note the following:     * The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify @*prod.example.com@ or @prod*.example.com@ .     * The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.     * If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard. /Important:/ You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS. You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, @*.example.com@ . You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example, @marketing.*.example.com@ . In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example, you can't specify @prod*.example.com@ .
