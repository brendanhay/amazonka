jobRun_jobName = Lens.lens (\JobRun' {jobName} -> jobName) (\s@JobRun' {} a -> s {jobName = a} :: JobRun)

-- | The name of the log group for secure logging that can be server-side
-- encrypted in Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This name can be
-- @\/aws-glue\/jobs\/@, in which case the default encryption is @NONE@. If
-- you add a role name and @SecurityConfiguration@ name (in other words,
-- @\/aws-glue\/jobs-yourRoleName-yourSecurityConfigurationName\/@), then
-- that security configuration is used to encrypt the log group.
jobRun_logGroupName :: Lens.Lens' JobRun (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text)
jobRun_logGroupName = Lens.lens (\JobRun' {logGroupName} -> logGroupName) (\s@JobRun' {} a -> s {logGroupName = a} :: JobRun)

-- | For Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker type,
-- the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated
-- when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that
-- consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more
-- information, see the
-- <https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/ Glue pricing page>.
--
-- For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a @Maximum capacity@.
-- Instead, you should specify a @Worker type@ and the @Number of workers@.
--
-- Do not set @MaxCapacity@ if using @WorkerType@ and @NumberOfWorkers@.
--
-- The value that can be allocated for @MaxCapacity@ depends on whether you
-- are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an Apache
-- Spark streaming ETL job:
--
-- -   When you specify a Python shell job
--     (@JobCommand.Name@=\"pythonshell\"), you can allocate either 0.0625
--     or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.
--
-- -   When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job
--     (@JobCommand.Name@=\"glueetl\") or Apache Spark streaming ETL job
--     (@JobCommand.Name@=\"gluestreaming\"), you can allocate from 2 to
--     100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job type cannot have a
--     fractional DPU allocation.

jobRun_startedOn :: Lens.Lens' JobRun (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.UTCTime)
jobRun_startedOn = Lens.lens (\JobRun' {startedOn} -> startedOn) (\s@JobRun' {} a -> s {startedOn = a} :: JobRun) Prelude.. Lens.mapping Data._Time

-- | The @JobRun@ timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job run
-- can consume resources before it is terminated and enters @TIMEOUT@
-- status. This value overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.
--
-- Streaming jobs do not have a timeout. The default for non-streaming jobs
-- is 2,880 minutes (48 hours).
jobRun_timeout :: Lens.Lens' JobRun (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural)
jobRun_timeout = Lens.lens (\JobRun' {timeout} -> timeout) (\s@JobRun' {} a -> s {timeout = a} :: JobRun)

-- | The name of the trigger that started this job run.
jobRun_triggerName :: Lens.Lens' JobRun (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text)
jobRun_triggerName = Lens.lens (\JobRun' {triggerName} -> triggerName) (\s@JobRun' {} a -> s {triggerName = a} :: JobRun)

-- | The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs. Accepts
-- a value of Standard, G.1X, G.2X, or G.025X for Spark jobs. Accepts the
-- value Z.2X for Ray jobs.
--
-- -   For the @Standard@ worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB
--     of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.
--
-- -   For the @G.1X@ worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPU, 16 GB
--     of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We
--     recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
--
-- -   For the @G.2X@ worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPU, 32 GB
--     of memory, 128 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We
--     recommend this worker type for memory-intensive jobs.
--
-- -   For the @G.025X@ worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPU,
--     4 GB of memory, 64 GB disk), and provides 1 executor per worker. We
--     recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This
--     worker type is only available for Glue version 3.0 streaming jobs.
--
-- -   For the @Z.2X@ worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPU, 64
--     GB of m emory, 128 GB disk), and provides up to 8 Ray workers (one
--     per vCPU) based on the autoscaler.
