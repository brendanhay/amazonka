-- | An array element of
-- DescribeTrainingJobResponse$SecondaryStatusTransitions. It provides
-- additional details about a status that the training job has transitioned
-- through. A training job can be in one of several states, for example,
-- starting, downloading, training, or uploading. Within each state, there
-- are a number of intermediate states. For example, within the starting
-- state, Amazon SageMaker could be starting the training job or launching
-- the ML instances. These transitional states are referred to as the
-- job\'s secondary status.

    -- Amazon SageMaker provides secondary statuses and status messages that
    -- apply to each of them:
    --
    -- [Starting]
    --     -   Starting the training job.
    --
    --     -   Launching requested ML instances.
    --
    --     -   Insufficient capacity error from EC2 while launching instances,
    --         retrying!
    --
    --     -   Launched instance was unhealthy, replacing it!
    --
    --     -   Preparing the instances for training.
    --
    -- [Training]
    --     -   Downloading the training image.
    --
    --     -   Training image download completed. Training in progress.
    --
    -- Status messages are subject to change. Therefore, we recommend not
    -- including them in code that programmatically initiates actions. For
    -- examples, don\'t use status messages in if statements.
    --
    -- To have an overview of your training job\'s progress, view
    -- @TrainingJobStatus@ and @SecondaryStatus@ in DescribeTrainingJob, and
    -- @StatusMessage@ together. For example, at the start of a training job,
    -- you might see the following:
    --
    -- -   @TrainingJobStatus@ - InProgress
    --
    -- -   @SecondaryStatus@ - Training
    --
    -- -   @StatusMessage@ - Downloading the training image
    statusMessage :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | A timestamp that shows when the training job transitioned out of this
    -- secondary status state into another secondary status state or when the
    -- training job has ended.
    endTime :: Prelude.Maybe Core.POSIX,
    -- | Contains a secondary status information from a training job.
    --
    -- Status might be one of the following secondary statuses:
    --
    -- [InProgress]
    --     -   @Starting@ - Starting the training job.
    --
    --     -   @Downloading@ - An optional stage for algorithms that support
    --         @File@ training input mode. It indicates that data is being
    --         downloaded to the ML storage volumes.
    --
    --     -   @Training@ - Training is in progress.
    --
    --     -   @Uploading@ - Training is complete and the model artifacts are
    --         being uploaded to the S3 location.
    --
    -- [Completed]
    --     -   @Completed@ - The training job has completed.
    --
    -- [Failed]
    --     -   @Failed@ - The training job has failed. The reason for the
    --         failure is returned in the @FailureReason@ field of
    --         @DescribeTrainingJobResponse@.
    --
    -- [Stopped]
    --     -   @MaxRuntimeExceeded@ - The job stopped because it exceeded the
    --         maximum allowed runtime.
    --
    --     -   @Stopped@ - The training job has stopped.
    --
    -- [Stopping]
    --     -   @Stopping@ - Stopping the training job.
