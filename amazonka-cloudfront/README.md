## Version

`1.0.0`


## Description

Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your
static and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, image,
and media files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through
a worldwide network of edge locations. When an end user requests content
that you\'re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge
location that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with
the best possible performance. If the content is already in that edge
location, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not
currently in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon
S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have
identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudfront)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
