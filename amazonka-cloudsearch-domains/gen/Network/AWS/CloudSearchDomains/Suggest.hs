-- Retrieves autocomplete suggestions for a partial query string. You can
-- use suggestions enable you to display likely matches before users finish
-- typing. In Amazon CloudSearch, suggestions are based on the contents of
-- a particular text field. When you request suggestions, Amazon
-- CloudSearch finds all of the documents whose values in the suggester
-- field start with the specified query string. The beginning of the field
-- must match the query string to be considered a match.
--
-- For more information about configuring suggesters and retrieving
-- suggestions, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/getting-suggestions.html Getting Suggestions>
-- in the /Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide/.
--
-- The endpoint for submitting 'Suggest' requests is domain-specific. You
-- submit suggest requests to a domain\'s search endpoint. To get the
-- search endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch
-- configuration service 'DescribeDomains' action. A domain\'s endpoints
-- are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch
-- console.
