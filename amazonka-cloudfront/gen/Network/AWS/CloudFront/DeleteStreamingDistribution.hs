-- Delete a streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.
--
--
-- __To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API__ :
--
--     * Disable the RTMP distribution.
--
--     * Submit a @GET Streaming Distribution Config@ request to get the current configuration and the @Etag@ header for the distribution.
--
--     * Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your @GET Streaming Distribution Config@ request to change the value of @Enabled@ to @false@ .
--
--     * Submit a @PUT Streaming Distribution Config@ request to update the configuration for your distribution. In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the HTTP @If-Match@ header to the value of the @ETag@ header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the @GET Streaming Distribution Config@ request in Step 2.
--
--     * Review the response to the @PUT Streaming Distribution Config@ request to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled.
--
--     * Submit a @GET Streaming Distribution Config@ request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of @Status@ is @Deployed@ .
--
--     * Submit a @DELETE Streaming Distribution@ request. Set the value of the HTTP @If-Match@ header to the value of the @ETag@ header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the @GET Streaming Distribution Config@ request in Step 2.
--
--     * Review the response to your @DELETE Streaming Distribution@ request to confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.
--
--

-- For information about deleting a distribution using the CloudFront console, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowToDeleteDistribution.html Deleting a Distribution> in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/ .
