-- Returns the default encryption configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. If
-- the bucket does not have a default encryption configuration,
-- GetBucketEncryption returns
-- @ServerSideEncryptionConfigurationNotFoundError@.
--
-- For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption>.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
-- @s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration@ action. The bucket owner has this
-- permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
-- others. For more information about permissions, see
