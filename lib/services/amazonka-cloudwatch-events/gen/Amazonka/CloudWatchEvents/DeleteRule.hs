-- Deletes the specified rule.
--
-- Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_RemoveTargets.html RemoveTargets>.
--
-- When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the
-- deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
--
-- If you call delete rule multiple times for the same rule, all calls will
-- succeed. When you call delete rule for a non-existent custom eventbus,
-- @ResourceNotFoundException@ is returned.
--
-- Managed rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web
-- Services service on your behalf. These rules are created by those other
-- Amazon Web Services services to support functionality in those services.
-- You can delete these rules using the @Force@ option, but you should do
-- so only if you are sure the other service is not still using that rule.
