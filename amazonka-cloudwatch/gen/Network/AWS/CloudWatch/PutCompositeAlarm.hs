--
-- Creates or updates a /composite alarm/. When you create a composite
-- alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into
-- account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The
-- composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule
-- are met.
--
-- The alarms specified in a composite alarm\'s rule expression can include
-- metric alarms and other composite alarms.
--
-- Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple
-- metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only
-- for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm
-- that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying
-- metric alarms are in ALARM state.
--
-- Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms
-- are notifying SNS topics.
--
-- It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
-- composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B
-- also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can\'t delete
-- any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always
-- still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
-- delete.
--
-- To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the
-- rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency
-- that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is
-- to change the @AlarmRule@ of one of the alarms to @False@.
--
-- Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
-- detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
--
-- When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
-- to @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
-- appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then
-- executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the
-- only time that the alarm can be in @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@ state.
--
-- When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
-- update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
--
-- If you are an IAM user, you must have @iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole@ to
-- create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.

    -- -   @TRUE@ always evaluates to TRUE.
    --
    -- -   @FALSE@ always evaluates to FALSE.

    -- TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex @AlarmRule@ structure,
    -- and for testing your alarm actions.
    --
    -- Alarm names specified in @AlarmRule@ can be surrounded with

    --     specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if
    --     CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is

    --     goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh
    --     is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This
    --     provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent
    --     noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm
    --     action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also
