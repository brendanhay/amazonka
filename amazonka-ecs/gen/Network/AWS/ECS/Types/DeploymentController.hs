    --     current running version of the container with the latest version.
    --     The number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service
    --     during a rolling update is controlled by adjusting the minimum and

    --     as specified in the DeploymentConfiguration.

    --     The blue\/green (@CODE_DEPLOY@) deployment type uses the blue\/green
    --     deployment model powered by AWS CodeDeploy, which allows you to
    --     verify a new deployment of a service before sending production
    --     traffic to it.
    --

    --     deployment process for an Amazon ECS service.
