-- | The Amazon S3 objects that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events are object-level API operations that access S3 objects, such as @GetObject@ , @DeleteObject@ , and @PutObject@ . You can specify up to 250 S3 buckets and object prefixes for a trail.
--
--
-- Example
--
--     * You create an event selector for a trail and specify an S3 bucket and an empty prefix, such as @arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/@ .
--
--     * You upload an image file to @bucket-1@ .
--
--     * The @PutObject@ API operation occurs on an object in the S3 bucket that you specified in the event selector. The trail processes and logs the event.
--
--     * You upload another image file to a different S3 bucket named @arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2@ .
--
--     * The event occurs on an object in an S3 bucket that you didn't specify in the event selector. The trail doesnâ€™t log the event.

To log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as @arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images@ . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix.
--
