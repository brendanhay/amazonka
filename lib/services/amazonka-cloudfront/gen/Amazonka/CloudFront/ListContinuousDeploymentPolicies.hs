-- Gets a list of the continuous deployment policies in your Amazon Web

-- You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the
-- response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum
-- that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To
-- get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the
-- @NextMarker@ value from the current response as the @Marker@ value in
-- the subsequent request.
