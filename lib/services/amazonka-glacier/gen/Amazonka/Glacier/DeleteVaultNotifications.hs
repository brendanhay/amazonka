-- This operation deletes the notification configuration set for a vault.
-- The operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time
-- for Amazon S3 Glacier to completely disable the notifications and you
-- might still receive some notifications for a short time after you send
-- the delete request.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
