## Description

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic
across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve greater
levels of fault tolerance in your applications, seamlessly providing the
required amount of load balancing capacity needed to distribute application
traffic.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elb)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
