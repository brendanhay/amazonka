--
-- Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication>
-- in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/.
--
-- To perform this operation, the user or role performing the operation
-- must have the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html iam:PassRole>
-- permission.
--
-- Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the
-- replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination
-- bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM
-- role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and
-- other relevant information.
--
-- A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can
-- contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to
-- replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose
-- additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.
--
-- To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a
-- replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule
-- element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or
-- more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
-- configuration, you must also add the following elements:
-- @DeleteMarkerReplication@, @Status@, and @Priority@.
--
-- If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration,
-- Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations Backward Compatibility>.
--
-- For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html Using Versioning>.
--
-- By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created
-- the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also
-- grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information
-- about permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html Specifying Permissions in a Policy>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources>.
--
-- __Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects__
--
-- By default, Amazon S3 doesn\'t replicate objects that are stored at rest
-- using server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate
-- AWS KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: @SourceSelectionCriteria@,
-- @SseKmsEncryptedObjects@, @Status@, @EncryptionConfiguration@, and
-- @ReplicaKmsKeyID@. For information about replication configuration, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS KMS>.
--
-- For information on @PutBucketReplication@ errors, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList List of replication-related error codes>

-- The following operations are related to @PutBucketReplication@:
