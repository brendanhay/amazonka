-- Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable
-- performance instances. The credit options are @standard@ and
-- @unlimited@.
--
-- If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable
-- performance instances with the @unlimited@ credit option, as well as
-- instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the
-- @unlimited@ credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance,
-- while it is configured as @unlimited@, to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2
-- returns the M4 instance.
--
-- If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit
-- option (@standard@ or @unlimited@) of those instances. If you specify an
-- instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a
-- burstable performance instance, an error is returned.
--
-- Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This
-- interval is usually less than one hour.
--
-- If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you
-- specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any
-- instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in
-- an unaffected zone, the call works normally.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html Burstable performance instances>
-- in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
