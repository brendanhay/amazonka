-- Deletes a gateway. To specify which gateway to delete, use the Amazon
-- Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request. The operation
-- deletes the gateway; however, it does not delete the gateway virtual
-- machine (VM) from your host computer.
--
-- After you delete a gateway, you cannot reactivate it. Completed
-- snapshots of the gateway volumes are not deleted upon deleting the
-- gateway, however, pending snapshots will not complete. After you delete
-- a gateway, your next step is to remove it from your environment.
--
-- You no longer pay software charges after the gateway is deleted;
-- however, your existing Amazon EBS snapshots persist and you will
-- continue to be billed for these snapshots. You can choose to remove all
-- remaining Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2
-- subscription.  If you prefer not to cancel your Amazon EC2 subscription,
-- you can delete your snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console. For more
-- information, see the
-- <http://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway AWS Storage Gateway detail page>.
