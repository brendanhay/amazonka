-- Disassociates a created artifact of an AWS resource with a migration task performed by a migration tool that was previously associated. This API has the following traits:
--
--
--     * A migration user can call the @DisassociateCreatedArtifacts@ operation to disassociate a created AWS Artifact from a migration task.
--
--     * The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: @arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b@ .
--
--     * Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or RDS instance, etc.
