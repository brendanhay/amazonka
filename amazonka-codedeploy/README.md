## Description

AWS CodeDeploy __Overview__

This is the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. This guide provides
descriptions of the AWS CodeDeploy APIs. For additional information, see
the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide AWS CodeDeploy User Guide>.

__Using the APIs__

You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to work with the following items:

-   Applications are unique identifiers that AWS CodeDeploy uses to
    ensure that the correct combinations of revisions, deployment
    configurations, and deployment groups are being referenced during
    deployments.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list,
    and update applications.

-   Deployment configurations are sets of deployment rules and
    deployment success and failure conditions that AWS CodeDeploy uses
    during deployments.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, and list
    deployment configurations.

-   Deployment groups are groups of instances to which application
    revisions can be deployed.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list,
    and update deployment groups.

-   Instances represent Amazon EC2 instances to which application
    revisions are deployed. Instances are identified by their Amazon EC2
    tags or Auto Scaling group names. Instances belong to deployment
    groups.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get and list instances.

-   Deployments represent the process of deploying revisions to
    instances.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, get, list, and stop
    deployments.

-   Application revisions are archive files that are stored in Amazon S3
    buckets or GitHub repositories. These revisions contain source
    content (such as source code, web pages, executable files, any
    deployment scripts, and similar) along with an Application
    Specification file (AppSpec file). (The AppSpec file is unique to
    AWS CodeDeploy; it defines a series of deployment actions that you
    want AWS CodeDeploy to execute.) An application revision is uniquely
    identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or
    both (for application revisions that are stored in Amazon S3
    buckets) or by its repository name and commit ID (for applications
    revisions that are stored in GitHub repositories). Application
    revisions are deployed through deployment groups.

    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get, list, and register
    application revisions.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codedeploy)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
