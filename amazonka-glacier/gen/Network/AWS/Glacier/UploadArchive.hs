--
-- This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous
-- operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted.
-- Amazon Glacier returns the archive ID in the @x-amz-archive-id@ header
-- of the response.
--
-- You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon Glacier. After
-- you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that
-- you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive
-- ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for
-- better searching. You can also use the optional archive description
-- field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of
-- archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get
-- the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
-- information, see InitiateJob.
--
-- You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For
-- information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html Computing Checksums>.
--
-- You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024
-- printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you
-- either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more
-- information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the
-- description in any way. An archive description does not need to be
-- unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive
-- list.
--
-- Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the
-- archive or its description.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
