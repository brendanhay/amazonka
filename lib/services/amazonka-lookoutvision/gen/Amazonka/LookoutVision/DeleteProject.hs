-- Deletes an Amazon Lookout for Vision project.
--
-- To delete a project, you must first delete each version of the model
-- associated with the project. To delete a model use the DeleteModel
-- operation.
--
-- You also have to delete the dataset(s) associated with the model. For
-- more information, see DeleteDataset. The images referenced by the
-- training and test datasets aren\'t deleted.
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the
-- @lookoutvision:DeleteProject@ operation.
