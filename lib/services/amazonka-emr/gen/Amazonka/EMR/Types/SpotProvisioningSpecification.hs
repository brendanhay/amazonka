-- | The launch specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet, which
-- determines the defined duration, provisioning timeout behavior, and
-- allocation strategy.
--
-- The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR
-- releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. Spot Instance
-- allocation strategy is available in Amazon EMR releases 5.12.1 and
-- later.
--
-- Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are
-- no longer available to new customers from July 1, 2021. For customers
-- who have previously used the feature, we will continue to support Spot
-- Instances with a defined duration until December 31, 2022.

    allocationStrategy :: Prelude.Maybe SpotProvisioningAllocationStrategy,
    -- | The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in
    -- minutes. When specified, the Spot Instance does not terminate before the

    -- ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for
    -- termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives
    -- the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.
