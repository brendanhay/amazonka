description:
    Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,
    container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage
    Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you
    launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls,
    allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,
    and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security
    groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.

    You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across
    your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and
    availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the
    need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration
    management systems or worry about scaling your management
    infrastructure.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.ECS" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>
    to get started.
