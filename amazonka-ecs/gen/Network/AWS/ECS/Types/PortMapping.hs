-- | Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container
-- instance to send or receive traffic. Port mappings are specified as part
-- of the container definition.
--
-- If you are using containers in a task with the @awsvpc@ or @host@
-- network mode, exposed ports should be specified using @containerPort@.
-- The @hostPort@ can be left blank or it must be the same value as the
-- @containerPort@.
--
-- After a task reaches the @RUNNING@ status, manual and automatic host and
-- container port assignments are visible in the @networkBindings@ section
-- of DescribeTasks API responses.
