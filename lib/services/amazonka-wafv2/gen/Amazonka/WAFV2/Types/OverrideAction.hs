-- | The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule
-- group evaluation. Set the override action to none to leave the result of
-- the rule group alone. Set it to count to override the result to count
-- only.

-- You can only use this for rule statements that reference a rule group,
-- like @RuleGroupReferenceStatement@ and @ManagedRuleGroupStatement@.
--
-- This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in
-- the rule group are evaluated. If you want the rules in the rule group to
-- only count matches, do not use this and instead use the rule action
-- override option, with @Count@ action, in your rule group reference
-- statement settings.
