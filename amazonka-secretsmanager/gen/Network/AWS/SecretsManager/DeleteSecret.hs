--
-- Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions. You can optionally
-- include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If
-- you don\'t specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30
-- days. Secrets Manager attaches a @DeletionDate@ stamp to the secret that
-- specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery
-- window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.
--
-- At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to
-- remove the @DeletionDate@ and cancel the deletion of the secret.
--
-- You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret
-- scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must
-- cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then retrieve the
-- information.
--
-- -   There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret.
--     Instead, remove all staging labels from the @VersionStage@ field of
--     a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets
--     Manager to delete it as needed. Versions without any staging labels
--     do not show up in ListSecretVersionIds unless you specify
--     @IncludeDeprecated@.
--
-- -   The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is
--     performed as a background task with low priority. There is no
--     guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the
--     actual delete operation to occur.
--
-- __Minimum permissions__
--
-- To run this command, you must have the following permissions:
--
-- -   secretsmanager:DeleteSecret
--
-- __Related operations__
--
-- -   To create a secret, use CreateSecret.
--
-- -   To cancel deletion of a version of a secret before the recovery
--     window has expired, use RestoreSecret.
