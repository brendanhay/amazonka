-- Deletes a hosted zone.
--
-- If the hosted zone was created by another service, such as AWS Cloud
-- Map, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DeleteHostedZone.html#delete-public-hosted-zone-created-by-another-service Deleting Public Hosted Zones That Were Created by Another Service>
-- in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/ for information about how to
-- delete it. (The process is the same for public and private hosted zones
-- that were created by another service.)
--
-- If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop
-- routing internet traffic to your website or web application, we
-- recommend that you delete resource record sets in the hosted zone
-- instead of deleting the hosted zone.
--
-- If you delete a hosted zone, you can\'t undelete it. You must create a
-- new hosted zone and update the name servers for your domain
-- registration, which can require up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you
-- delegated responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone and you delete
-- the child hosted zone, you must update the name servers in the parent
-- hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone, someone could
-- hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using your
-- domain name.
--
-- If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can
-- transfer DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service. When you
-- transfer DNS service, you have to update the name servers for the domain
-- registration. If the domain is registered with Route 53, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_UpdateDomainNameservers.html UpdateDomainNameservers>
-- for information about how to replace Route 53 name servers with name
-- servers for the new DNS service. If the domain is registered with
-- another registrar, use the method provided by the registrar to update
-- name servers for the domain registration. For more information, perform
-- an internet search on \"free DNS service.\"
--
-- You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA
-- record and NS resource record sets. If the hosted zone contains other
-- resource record sets, you must delete them before you can delete the
-- hosted zone. If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other
-- resource record sets, the request fails, and Route 53 returns a
-- @HostedZoneNotEmpty@ error. For information about deleting records from
-- your hosted zone, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html ChangeResourceRecordSets>.
--
-- To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the
-- following:
--
-- -   Use the @GetHostedZone@ action to request information about the
--     hosted zone.
--
-- -   Use the @ListHostedZones@ action to get a list of the hosted zones
--     associated with the current AWS account.
