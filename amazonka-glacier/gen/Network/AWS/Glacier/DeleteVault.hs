-- This operation deletes a vault. Amazon Glacier will delete a vault only
-- if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and there
-- have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If either of
-- these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails (that is,
-- the vault is not removed) and Amazon Glacier returns an error. You can
-- use DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a vault, and you
-- can use
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html Initiate a Job (POST jobs)>
-- to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory
-- contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html Delete Archive (DELETE archive)>.
--
-- This operation is idempotent.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
