-- When you no longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be
-- released. On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into @released@
-- state. The host ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no
-- longer be specified in another request, for example, to modify the host.
-- You must stop or terminate all instances on a host before it can be
-- released.
--
-- When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time for them to
-- stop counting toward your limit and you may receive capacity errors when
-- trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts. Wait a few minutes and then try
-- again.
--
-- Released hosts still appear in a DescribeHosts response.
