description:
    AWS Device Farm is a service that enables mobile app developers to test
    Android, iOS, and Fire OS apps on physical phones, tablets, and other
    devices in the cloud.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.DeviceFarm" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
