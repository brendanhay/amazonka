--
-- @CreateMembers@ is used to send invitations to accounts. For the
-- organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account uses
-- @CreateMembers@ to enable organization accounts as member accounts.
--
-- For invited accounts, @CreateMembers@ sends a request to invite the
-- specified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the
-- behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator
-- account for a behavior graph.
--
-- @CreateMembers@ verifies the accounts and then invites the verified
-- accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send
-- invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the
-- administrator manages their member accounts centrally.
--
-- For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,
-- @CreateMembers@ attempts to enable the accounts. The organization
-- accounts do not receive invitations.
--
-- The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to
-- invite or to enable.
--
-- The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:
--
-- -   The accounts that @CreateMembers@ was able to process. For invited
--     accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that
--     have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed
--     verification. For organization accounts in the organization behavior
--     graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and that cannot be
--     enabled.
--
-- -   The accounts that @CreateMembers@ was unable to process. This list
--     includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in
--     the behavior graph.
