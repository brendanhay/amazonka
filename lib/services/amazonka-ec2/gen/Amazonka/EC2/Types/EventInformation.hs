    --
    -- @error@ events:
    --
    -- -   @iamFleetRoleInvalid@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet does not have
    --     the required permissions either to launch or terminate an instance.
    --
    -- -   @allLaunchSpecsTemporarilyBlacklisted@ - None of the configurations
    --     are valid, and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For
    --     more information, see the description of the event.
    --
    -- -   @spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded@ - You\'ve reached the limit on the
    --     number of Spot Instances that you can launch.
    --
    -- -   @spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid@ - The configuration is not
    --     valid. For more information, see the description of the event.
    --
    -- @fleetRequestChange@ events:
    --
    -- -   @active@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has been validated
    --     and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the target number of
    --     running instances.
    --
    -- -   @deleted@ (EC2 Fleet) \/ @cancelled@ (Spot Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is
    --     deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled and has no running
    --     instances. The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet will be deleted two days
    --     after its instances are terminated.
    --
    -- -   @deleted_running@ (EC2 Fleet) \/ @cancelled_running@ (Spot Fleet) -
    --     The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is canceled and
    --     does not launch additional instances. Its existing instances
    --     continue to run until they are interrupted or terminated. The
    --     request remains in this state until all instances are interrupted or
    --     terminated.
    --
    -- -   @deleted_terminating@ (EC2 Fleet) \/ @cancelled_terminating@ (Spot
    --     Fleet) - The EC2 Fleet is deleted or the Spot Fleet request is
    --     canceled and its instances are terminating. The request remains in
    --     this state until all instances are terminated.
    --
    -- -   @expired@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has expired. If the
    --     request was created with @TerminateInstancesWithExpiration@ set, a
    --     subsequent @terminated@ event indicates that the instances are
    --     terminated.
    --
    -- -   @modify_in_progress@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being
    --     modified. The request remains in this state until the modification
    --     is fully processed.
    --
    -- -   @modify_succeeded@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request was
    --     modified.
    --
    -- -   @submitted@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being evaluated
    --     and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the target number of
    --     instances.
    --
    -- -   @progress@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is in the process
    --     of being fulfilled.
    --
    -- @instanceChange@ events:
    --
    -- -   @launched@ - A new instance was launched.
    --
    -- -   @terminated@ - An instance was terminated by the user.
    --
    -- -   @termination_notified@ - An instance termination notification was
    --     sent when a Spot Instance was terminated by Amazon EC2 during
    --     scale-down, when the target capacity of the fleet was modified down,
    --     for example, from a target capacity of 4 to a target capacity of 3.
    --
    -- @Information@ events:
    --
    -- -   @fleetProgressHalted@ - The price in every launch specification is
    --     not valid because it is below the Spot price (all the launch
    --     specifications have produced @launchSpecUnusable@ events). A launch
    --     specification might become valid if the Spot price changes.
    --
    -- -   @launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted@ - The configuration is not valid
    --     and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more
    --     information, see the description of the event.
    --
    -- -   @launchSpecUnusable@ - The price in a launch specification is not
    --     valid because it is below the Spot price.
    --
    -- -   @registerWithLoadBalancersFailed@ - An attempt to register instances
    --     with load balancers failed. For more information, see the
    --     description of the event.
