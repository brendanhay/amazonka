    -- that Cloud Map creates when you register an instance and specify this
    -- service.
    --
    -- If you want to use this service to register instances that create alias
    -- records, specify @WEIGHTED@ for the routing policy.
    --
    -- You can specify the following values:
    --
    -- [MULTIVALUE]
    --     If you define a health check for the service and the health check is
    --     healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight
    --     instances.
    --
    --     For example, suppose that the service includes configurations for
    --     one @A@ record and a health check. You use the service to register
    --     10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for
    --     up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are
    --     healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses
    --     for all of the healthy instances.
    --
    --     If you don\'t define a health check for the service, Route 53
    --     assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up

    --
    -- [WEIGHTED]
    --     Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected
    --     instance from among the instances that you registered using the same
    --     service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can\'t
    --     route more or less traffic to any instances.
