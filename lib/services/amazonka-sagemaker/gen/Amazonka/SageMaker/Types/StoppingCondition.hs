-- | Specifies a limit to how long a model training job or model compilation
-- job can run. It also specifies how long a managed spot training job has
-- to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the
-- training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs.
--
-- To stop a training job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the @SIGTERM@
-- signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use
-- this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of
-- training are not lost.
--
-- The training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the
-- intermediate results of a model training job when possible. This attempt
-- to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a
-- state from which it can be saved. For example, if training has just
-- started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved, this
-- intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a
-- model with @CreateModel@.
--
-- The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving
-- intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the
-- maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete.
