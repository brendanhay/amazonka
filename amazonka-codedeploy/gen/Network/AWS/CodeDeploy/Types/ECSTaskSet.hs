-- | Information about a set of Amazon ECS tasks in an AWS CodeDeploy
-- deployment. An Amazon ECS task set includes details such as the desired
-- number of tasks, how many tasks are running, and whether the task set
-- serves production traffic. An AWS CodeDeploy application that uses the
-- Amazon ECS compute platform deploys a containerized application in an
-- Amazon ECS service as a task set.

    --

-- for backwards compatibility:
--
-- 'status', 'eCSTaskSet_status' - The status of the task set. There are three valid task set statuses:
--
-- -   @PRIMARY@: Indicates the task set is serving production traffic.
--
-- -   @ACTIVE@: Indicates the task set is not serving production traffic.
--
-- -   @DRAINING@: Indicates the tasks in the task set are being stopped
--     and their corresponding targets are being deregistered from their
--     target group.
--
-- 'runningCount', 'eCSTaskSet_runningCount' - The number of tasks in the task set that are in the @RUNNING@ status
-- during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the @RUNNING@ state is
-- running and ready for use.
--
-- 'desiredCount', 'eCSTaskSet_desiredCount' - The number of tasks in a task set. During a deployment that uses the
-- Amazon ECS compute type, CodeDeploy instructs Amazon ECS to create a new
-- task set and uses this value to determine how many tasks to create.
-- After the updated task set is created, CodeDeploy shifts traffic to the

--
-- 'pendingCount', 'eCSTaskSet_pendingCount' - The number of tasks in the task set that are in the @PENDING@ status
-- during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task in the @PENDING@ state is
-- preparing to enter the @RUNNING@ state. A task set enters the @PENDING@
-- status when it launches for the first time, or when it is restarted
-- after being in the @STOPPED@ state.
--
-- 'taskSetLabel', 'eCSTaskSet_taskSetLabel' - A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an original target
-- (@BLUE@) or a replacement target (@GREEN@).

-- 'targetGroup', 'eCSTaskSet_targetGroup' - The target group associated with the task set. The target group is used
-- by AWS CodeDeploy to manage traffic to a task set.
--
-- 'trafficWeight', 'eCSTaskSet_trafficWeight' - The percentage of traffic served by this task set.
--
