    -- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can

    --
    -- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
    --
    -- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
    --     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for

--
-- There are two service scheduler strategies available.
--
-- -   @REPLICA@-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
--     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
--     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
--     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
--     decisions.
--
-- -   @DAEMON@-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
--     each active container instance. This task meets all of the task
--     placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service
--     scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running
--     tasks. It stop tasks that don\'t meet the placement constraints.
--
--     Fargate tasks don\'t support the @DAEMON@ scheduling strategy.

-- format, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html#ecs-resource-ids Amazon Resource Name (ARN)>

-- | The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),

-- | The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
-- organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You
-- define bot the key and value.
--
-- The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
--
-- -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
--
-- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
--     have only one value.
--
-- -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
--     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
--     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
--     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
--     characters: + - = . _ : \/ \@.
--
-- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
--
-- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
--     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
--     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
--     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
--     your tags per resource limit.
