-- | An invocation is a copy of a command sent to a specific managed node. A
-- command can apply to one or more managed nodes. A command invocation
-- applies to one managed node. For example, if a user runs @SendCommand@
-- against three managed nodes, then a command invocation is created for
-- each requested managed node ID. A command invocation returns status and
-- detail information about a command you ran.
