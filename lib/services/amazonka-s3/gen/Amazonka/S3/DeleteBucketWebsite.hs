-- This action removes the website configuration for a bucket. Amazon S3
-- returns a @200 OK@ response upon successfully deleting a website
-- configuration on the specified bucket. You will get a @200 OK@ response
-- if the website configuration you are trying to delete does not exist on
-- the bucket. Amazon S3 returns a @404@ response if the bucket specified
-- in the request does not exist.
--
-- This DELETE action requires the @S3:DeleteBucketWebsite@ permission. By
-- default, only the bucket owner can delete the website configuration
-- attached to a bucket. However, bucket owners can grant other users
-- permission to delete the website configuration by writing a bucket
-- policy granting them the @S3:DeleteBucketWebsite@ permission.
