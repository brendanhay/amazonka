-- Deletes the specified VPC. You must detach or delete all gateways and
-- resources that are associated with the VPC before you can delete it. For
-- example, you must terminate all instances running in the VPC, delete all
-- security groups associated with the VPC (except the default one), delete
-- all route tables associated with the VPC (except the default one), and
-- so on.
