-- | Specifies the configuration for a hyperparameter tuning job that uses
-- one or more previous hyperparameter tuning jobs as a starting point. The
-- results of previous tuning jobs are used to inform which combinations of
-- hyperparameters to search over in the new tuning job.
--
-- All training jobs launched by the new hyperparameter tuning job are
-- evaluated by using the objective metric, and the training job that
-- performs the best is compared to the best training jobs from the parent
-- tuning jobs. From these, the training job that performs the best as
-- measured by the objective metric is returned as the overall best
-- training job.
--
-- All training jobs launched by parent hyperparameter tuning jobs and the
-- new hyperparameter tuning jobs count against the limit of training jobs
-- for the tuning job.

    --     are allowed. You can also change hyperparameters from tunable to
    --     static, and from static to tunable, but the total number of static
    --     plus tunable hyperparameters must remain the same as it is in all
