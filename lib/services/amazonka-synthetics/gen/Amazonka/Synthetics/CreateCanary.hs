-- Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and
-- APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and
-- latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating
-- load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up
-- a canary to run continuously or just once.
--
-- Do not use @CreateCanary@ to modify an existing canary. Use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html UpdateCanary>
-- instead.
--
-- To create canaries, you must have the @CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess@
-- policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need
-- the @iam:CreateRole@, @iam:CreatePolicy@ and @iam:AttachRolePolicy@
-- permissions. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles Necessary Roles and Permissions>.
--
-- Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names.
-- The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
-- canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries>.
