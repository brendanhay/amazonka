--
-- The @ApproveAssignment@ operation approves the results of a completed
-- assignment.
--
-- Approving an assignment initiates two payments from the Requester\'s
-- Amazon.com account
--
-- -   The Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward specified in
--     the HIT.
--
-- -   Amazon Mechanical Turk fees are debited.
--
-- If the Requester\'s account does not have adequate funds for these
-- payments, the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the
-- approval is not processed. You can include an optional feedback message
-- with the approval, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the
-- web site.
--
-- You can also call this operation for assignments that were previous
-- rejected and approve them by explicitly overriding the previous
-- rejection. This only works on rejected assignments that were submitted
-- within the previous 30 days and only if the assignment\'s related HIT
-- has not been deleted.
