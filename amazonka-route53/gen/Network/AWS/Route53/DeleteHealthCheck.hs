-- Deletes a health check.
--
-- Amazon Route 53 does not prevent you from deleting a health check even
-- if the health check is associated with one or more resource record sets.
-- If you delete a health check and you don\'t update the associated
-- resource record sets, the future status of the health check can\'t be
-- predicted and may change. This will affect the routing of DNS queries
-- for your DNS failover configuration. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating-deleting.html#health-checks-deleting.html Replacing and Deleting Health Checks>
-- in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/.
--
-- If you\'re using AWS Cloud Map and you configured Cloud Map to create a
-- Route 53 health check when you register an instance, you can\'t use the
-- Route 53 @DeleteHealthCheck@ command to delete the health check. The
-- health check is deleted automatically when you deregister the instance;
-- there can be a delay of several hours before the health check is deleted
-- from Route 53.
