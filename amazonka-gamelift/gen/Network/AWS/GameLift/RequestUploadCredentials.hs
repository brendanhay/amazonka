-- Retrieves a fresh set of upload credentials and the assigned Amazon S3 storage location for a specific build. Valid credentials are required to upload your game build files to Amazon S3.
--
-- Call this action only if you need credentials for a build created with < CreateBuild>. This is a rare situation; in most cases, builds are created using the CLI command 'upload-build', which creates a build record and also uploads build files.
--
-- Upload credentials are returned when you create the build, but they have a limited lifespan. You can get fresh credentials and use them to re-upload game files until the state of that build changes to READY. Once this happens, you must create a brand new build.
