-- This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from the 'InProgress' state to the 'Locked' state, which causes the vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the 'InProgress' state by calling < InitiateVaultLock>. You can obtain the state of the vault lock by calling < GetVaultLock>. For more information about the vault locking process, <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-lock.html Amazon Glacier Vault Lock>.
--
-- This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the 'Locked' state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to lock the vault.
--
-- If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the 'Locked' state, the operation returns an 'AccessDeniedException' error. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the 'InProgress' state, the operation throws an 'InvalidParameter' error.
