-- Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket
-- to add an object to it.
--
-- Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response,
-- Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use
-- @PutObject@ to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing
-- object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want
-- to update some values.
--
-- Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write
-- requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
-- last object written. To prevent objects from being deleted or
-- overwritten, you can use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html Amazon S3 Object Lock>.
--
-- To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
-- @Content-MD5@ header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the
-- object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns
-- an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an
-- object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5
-- value.
--
-- -   To successfully complete the @PutObject@ request, you must have the
--     @s3:PutObject@ in your IAM permissions.
--
-- -   To successfully change the objects acl of your @PutObject@ request,
--     you must have the @s3:PutObjectAcl@ in your IAM permissions.
--
-- -   To successfully set the tag-set with your @PutObject@ request, you
--     must have the @s3:PutObjectTagging@ in your IAM permissions.
--
-- -   The @Content-MD5@ header is required for any request to upload an
--     object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object
--     Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview>
--     in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- You have four mutually exclusive options to protect data using
-- server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to
-- manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are
-- Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS
-- or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts
-- data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys
-- (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data
-- at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption>.
--
-- When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based
-- permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined
-- groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL
-- on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has
-- full access control. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html Managing ACLs Using the REST API>.
--
-- If the bucket that you\'re uploading objects to uses the bucket owner
-- enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no
-- longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT
-- requests that don\'t specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket
-- owner full control ACLs, such as the @bucket-owner-full-control@ canned
-- ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT
-- requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain
-- Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a @400@ error with the
-- error code @AccessControlListNotSupported@. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object
-- Ownership, all objects written to the bucket by any account will be
-- owned by the bucket owner.
--
-- By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
-- created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
-- high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
-- different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
-- Storage Class. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html Storage Classes>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates
-- a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this
-- ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon
-- S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously,
-- it stores all of the objects. For more information about versioning, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets>.
-- For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html GetBucketVersioning>.
