-- | The amount of instance usage, in normalized units. Normalized units
-- enable you to see your EC2 usage for multiple sizes of instances in a
-- uniform way. For example, suppose you run an xlarge instance and a
-- 2xlarge instance. If you run both instances for the same amount of time,
-- the 2xlarge instance uses twice as much of your reservation as the
-- xlarge instance, even though both instances show only one instance-hour.
-- Using normalized units instead of instance-hours, the xlarge instance
-- used 8 normalized units, and the 2xlarge instance used 16 normalized
-- units.
