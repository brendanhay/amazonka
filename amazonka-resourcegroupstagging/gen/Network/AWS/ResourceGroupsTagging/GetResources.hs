-- Returns all the tagged resources that are associated with the specified tags (keys and values) located in the specified region for the AWS account. The tags and the resource types that you specify in the request are known as /filters/ . The response includes all tags that are associated with the requested resources. If no filter is provided, this action returns a paginated resource list with the associated tags.

-- | Creates a value of 'GetResources' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'grPaginationToken' - A string that indicates that additional data is available. Leave this value empty for your initial request. If the response includes a @PaginationToken@ , use that string for this value to request an additional page of data.
--
-- * 'grResourcesPerPage' - A limit that restricts the number of resources returned by GetResources in paginated output. You can set ResourcesPerPage to a minimum of 1 item and the maximum of 50 items.
--
-- * 'grResourceTypeFilters' - The constraints on the resources that you want returned. The format of each resource type is @service[:resourceType]@ . For example, specifying a resource type of @ec2@ returns all tagged Amazon EC2 resources (which includes tagged EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of @ec2:instance@ returns only EC2 instances.  The string for each service name and resource type is the same as that embedded in a resource's Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Consult the /AWS General Reference/ for the following:     * For a list of service name strings, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#genref-aws-service-namespaces AWS Service Namespaces> .     * For resource type strings, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html#arns-syntax Example ARNs> .     * For more information about ARNs, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces> .
--
-- * 'grTagFilters' - A list of tags (keys and values). A request can include up to 50 keys, and each key can include up to 20 values. If you specify multiple filters connected by an AND operator in a single request, the response returns only those resources that are associated with every specified filter. If you specify multiple filters connected by an OR operator in a single request, the response returns all resources that are associated with at least one or possibly more of the specified filters.
--
-- * 'grTagsPerPage' - A limit that restricts the number of tags (key and value pairs) returned by GetResources in paginated output. A resource with no tags is counted as having one tag (one key and value pair). @GetResources@ does not split a resource and its associated tags across pages. If the specified @TagsPerPage@ would cause such a break, a @PaginationToken@ is returned in place of the affected resource and its tags. Use that token in another request to get the remaining data. For example, if you specify a @TagsPerPage@ of @100@ and the account has 22 resources with 10 tags each (meaning that each resource has 10 key and value pairs), the output will consist of 3 pages, with the first page displaying the first 10 resources, each with its 10 tags, the second page displaying the next 10 resources each with its 10 tags, and the third page displaying the remaining 2 resources, each with its 10 tags. You can set @TagsPerPage@ to a minimum of 100 items and the maximum of 500 items.
