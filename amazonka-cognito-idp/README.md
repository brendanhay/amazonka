## Version

`1.4.3`


## Description

You can create a user pool in Amazon Cognito Identity to manage directories and users. You can authenticate a user to obtain tokens related to user identity and access policies.

This API reference provides information about user pools in Amazon Cognito Identity.

For more information, see <https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ Amazon Cognito>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cognito-idp)
and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
