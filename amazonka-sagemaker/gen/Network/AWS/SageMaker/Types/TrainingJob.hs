    --     -   @Completed@ - The training job has completed.
    --
    -- [Failed]
    --     -   @Failed@ - The training job has failed. The reason for the
    --         failure is returned in the @FailureReason@ field of
    --         @DescribeTrainingJobResponse@.
    --
    -- [Stopped]

--
-- Amazon SageMaker provides primary statuses and secondary statuses that
-- apply to each of them:
--
-- [InProgress]
--     -   @Starting@ - Starting the training job.
--
--     -   @Downloading@ - An optional stage for algorithms that support
--         @File@ training input mode. It indicates that data is being
--         downloaded to the ML storage volumes.
--
--     -   @Training@ - Training is in progress.
--
--     -   @Uploading@ - Training is complete and the model artifacts are
--         being uploaded to the S3 location.
--
-- [Completed]
--     -   @Completed@ - The training job has completed.
--
-- [Failed]
--     -   @Failed@ - The training job has failed. The reason for the
--         failure is returned in the @FailureReason@ field of
--         @DescribeTrainingJobResponse@.
--
-- [Stopped]
--     -   @MaxRuntimeExceeded@ - The job stopped because it exceeded the
--         maximum allowed runtime.
--
--     -   @Stopped@ - The training job has stopped.
--
-- [Stopping]
--     -   @Stopping@ - Stopping the training job.
--
-- Valid values for @SecondaryStatus@ are subject to change.
--
-- We no longer support the following secondary statuses:
--
-- -   @LaunchingMLInstances@
--
-- -   @PreparingTrainingStack@
--
-- -   @DownloadingTrainingImage@
