-- The /DeleteReplicationGroup/ action deletes an existing replication
-- group. By default, this action deletes the entire replication group,
-- including the primary cluster and all of the read replicas. You can
-- optionally delete only the read replicas, while retaining the primary
-- cluster.
--
-- When you receive a successful response from this action, Amazon
-- ElastiCache immediately begins deleting the selected resources; you
-- cannot cancel or revert this action.
