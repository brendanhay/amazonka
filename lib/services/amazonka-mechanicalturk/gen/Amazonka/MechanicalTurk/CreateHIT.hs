--
-- The @CreateHIT@ operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT).
-- The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the
-- Amazon Mechanical Turk website.
--
-- This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for
-- the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number
-- of assignments. When you pass these values to @CreateHIT@, a new HIT is
-- created for you, with a new @HITTypeID@. The HITTypeID can be used to
-- create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common
-- parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.
--
-- An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using
-- the @CreateHITType@ operation and then call the @CreateHITWithHITType@
-- operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are
-- creating large numbers of HITs.
--
-- CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by
-- providing a value for the @Question@ parameter that fully specifies the
-- contents of the HIT, or by providing a @HitLayoutId@ and associated
-- @HitLayoutParameters@.
--
-- If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an
-- additional fee. For more information, see
-- <https://requester.mturk.com/pricing Amazon Mechanical Turk Pricing>.
