-- | Provides the input image either as bytes or an S3 object.
--
-- You pass image bytes to an Amazon Rekognition API operation by using the
-- @Bytes@ property. For example, you would use the @Bytes@ property to
-- pass an image loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed by
-- using the @Bytes@ property must be base64-encoded. Your code may not
-- need to encode image bytes if you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon
-- Rekognition API operations.
--
-- For more information, see Analyzing an Image Loaded from a Local File
-- System in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
--
-- You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Rekognition API
-- operation by using the @S3Object@ property. Images stored in an S3
-- bucket do not need to be base64-encoded.
--
-- The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the
-- region you use for Amazon Rekognition operations.
--
-- If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing
-- image bytes using the Bytes property is not supported. You must first
-- upload the image to an Amazon S3 bucket and then call the operation
-- using the S3Object property.
--
-- For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have
-- permission to access the S3 object. For more information, see Resource
-- Based Policies in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
