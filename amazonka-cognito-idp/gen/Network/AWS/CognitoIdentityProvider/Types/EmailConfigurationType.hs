  { -- | Specifies whether Amazon Cognito emails your users by using its built-in
    -- email functionality or your Amazon SES email configuration. Specify one
    -- of the following values:
    --
    -- [COGNITO_DEFAULT]
    --     When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in email
    --     functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito
    --     allows only a limited number of emails each day for your user pool.
    --     For typical production environments, the default email limit is
    --     below the required delivery volume. To achieve a higher delivery
    --     volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES email
    --     configuration.
    --
    --     To look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html Limits in Amazon Cognito>
    --     in the /Amazon Cognito Developer Guide/.
    --
    --     The default FROM address is no-reply\@verificationemail.com. To
    --     customize the FROM address, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES
    --     verified email address for the @SourceArn@ parameter.
    --
    --     If EmailSendingAccount is COGNITO_DEFAULT, the following parameters
    --     aren\'t allowed:
    --
    --     -   EmailVerificationMessage
    --
    --     -   EmailVerificationSubject
    --
    --     -   InviteMessageTemplate.EmailMessage
    --
    --     -   InviteMessageTemplate.EmailSubject
    --
    --     -   VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailMessage
    --

    --
    --     -   VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubject,
    --
    --     -   VerificationMessageTemplate.EmailSubjectByLink
    --
    --     DEVELOPER EmailSendingAccount is required.
    --
    -- [DEVELOPER]
    --     When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES
    --     configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to
    --     send email from your verified email address. When you use this
    --     option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply to
    --     your Amazon SES verified email address in your AWS account.
    --
    --     If you use this option, you must provide the ARN of an Amazon SES
    --     verified email address for the @SourceArn@ parameter.
    --
    --     Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional
    --     permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your
    --     user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a /service-linked
    --     role/, which is a type of IAM role, in your AWS account. This role
    --     contains the permissions that allow Amazon Cognito to access Amazon
    --     SES and send email messages with your address. For more information
    --     about the service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito>

    -- their email address. For example, @testuser\@example.com@ or
    -- @Test User \<testuser\@example.com>@. This address will appear before
    -- the body of the email.
    from :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a verified email address in Amazon
    -- SES. This email address is used in one of the following ways, depending
    -- on the value that you specify for the @EmailSendingAccount@ parameter:
    --
    -- -   If you specify @COGNITO_DEFAULT@, Amazon Cognito uses this address
    --     as the custom FROM address when it emails your users by using its
    --     built-in email account.
    --
    -- -   If you specify @DEVELOPER@, Amazon Cognito emails your users with
    --     this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf.
    sourceArn :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The set of configuration rules that can be applied to emails sent using
    -- Amazon SES. A configuration set is applied to an email by including a
    -- reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. Once
    -- applied, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the
    -- email. Configuration sets can be used to apply the following types of
    -- rules to emails:
    --
    -- -   Event publishing – Amazon SES can track the number of send,
    --     delivery, open, click, bounce, and complaint events for each email
    --     sent. Use event publishing to send information about these events to
    --     other AWS services such as SNS and CloudWatch.
    --
    -- -   IP pool management – When leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon
    --     SES, you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedicated IP
    --     pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools with
    --     configuration sets.
