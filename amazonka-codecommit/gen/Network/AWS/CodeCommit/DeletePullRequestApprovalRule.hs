-- Deletes an approval rule from a specified pull request. Approval rules
-- can be deleted from a pull request only if the pull request is open, and
-- if the approval rule was created specifically for a pull request and not
-- generated from an approval rule template associated with the repository
-- where the pull request was created. You cannot delete an approval rule
-- from a merged or closed pull request.
