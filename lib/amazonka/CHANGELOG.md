# Change Log

## Unreleased

### Changed

- `amazonka-dynamodb`: `TransactWriteItem` is now a sum type (thanks @Tristano8).
[\#1020](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/1020)
- `amazonka-core`: Add regions: `Malaysia` (`ap-southeast-5`), `Thailand` (`ap-southeast-7`), `Calgary` (`ca-west-1`), and `TelAviv` (`il-central-1`)
[\#1017](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/1017)
- Depend on `microlens`, `microlens-pro` and `microlens-contra` instead of the full `lens` package (thanks @mankykitty).
[\#996](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/996)
  - `amazonka-s3`: `objectKey_keyComponents` has a new type `Delimiter -> Traversal' ObjectKey Text` instead of returning `IndexedTraversal' ObjectKey Text`. `lens` users can rebuild the `IndexedTraversal'` with [`Control.Lens.Indexed.indexing`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-5.3.2/docs/Control-Lens-Indexed.html#v:indexing). `optics` uses can use one of the following:
    ```haskell
    import Optics
    import Optics.Internal.Indexed (indexing)

    objectKey_KeyComponents' :: IxTraversal' Int ObjectKey Text
    objectKey_KeyComponents' = itraversalVL $ indexing objectKey_KeyComponents

    -- Or, if you prefer to avoid imports from .Internal modules:
    objectKey_KeyComponents'' :: IxTraversal' Int ObjectKey Text
    objectKey_KeyComponents'' = elementsOf (traversalVL objectKey_KeyComponents) (const True)
    ```

- `amazonka`: Add `(Typeable req, Typeable (AWSResponse req))` to the superclasses of `class AWSRequest`.
  `Typeable` is required for any nontrivial use of `AWSRequest` because Amazonka routes requests through the hooks system in `Amazonka.Env.Hooks`, so this reduces a little visual clutter. (Thanks @dalpd) [\#993](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/993),[\#994](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/994),[\#1015](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/1015)
- New package `amazonka-dynamodb-attributevalue`: `amazonka-dynamodb`and `amazonka-dynamodb-streams` now share a common `AttributeValue` type, removing the need to manually convert between them. Each SDK re-exports it, so no code changes should be necessary, but manual conversion between the "regular" and "streams" `AttributeValue` can be removed. (thanks @dalpd)
[\#992](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/992)
- `amazonka`: Add support for `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variables to override the
  default paths `$HOME/.aws/credentials` and `$HOME/.aws/config` [\#951](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/951). The typo in `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` was fixed in [\#1007](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/1007).

### Fixed

- `amazonka-*`: GHC 9.8 support
[\#972](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/972)
- `amazonka`: Allow reading the AWS config file when the credentials file is missing [\#951](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/951).
  This is useful when you are using a role-based authentication method or AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) which does not require a credentials file.
  Before this fix you had to create an empty credentials file for these methods to work correctly.
- `amazonka`: During logging, do not print bytestrings that have unprintable characters
[\#952](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/952)
- `amazonka`: Support reading values of IMDS metadata tags, add `Metadata.Other` constructor
[\#955](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/955)
- `amazonka-core`: Support Cloudflare R2 by adjusting which headers get signed
[\#977](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/977)


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/tree/2.0.0)
Released: **28 July 2023**, Compare: [2.0.0-rc2](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/compare/2.0.0-rc2...2.0.0)

### Changed

- `amazonka`: Update two missing EC2 metadata keys from [instance metadata categories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html)
[\#935](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/935)
- `amazonka`: Stop re-exporting a subset of EC2 metadata keys from the root `Amazonka` module.
[\#940](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/940)
  - Metadata users should import `Amazonka.EC2.Metadata` directly.
  - The functions `Amazonka.dynamic`, `Amazonka.metadata` and `Amazonka.userdata` have been removed in favour of their equivalents in `Amazonka.EC2.Metadata` which only require a HTTP `Manager`, not an entire `Env`.
  - It is easy to share a single `Manager` between metadata requests and an Amazonka `Env`:
    - If you create the `Env` first, you can read its `manager :: Manager` field.
    - If you make metadata requests before calling `newEnv`, you must create a `Manager` youself. You can pass this `Manager` to `newEnvFromManager`.

### Fixed

- `aeson ^>= 2.2` is now supported.
[\#938](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/938)

## [2.0.0 RC2](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/tree/2.0.0-rc2)
Released: **10th July, 2023**, Compare: [2.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/compare/2.0.0-rc1...2.0.0-rc2)

### Major Changes

- A system of "hooks" was added in PR [\#875](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/875), allowing library clients to inject custom behavior at key points in the request/response cycle. Logging has been reimplemented in terms of these hooks, but they open up a lot of other customization options. Some examples of things that should now be possible:

  - Injecting a [Trace ID for AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader) into each request before it is signed and sent,
  - Selectively silencing logging for expected error messages, such as DynamoDB's `ConditionalCheckFailedException`, and
  - Logging all requests Amazonka makes to a separate log, enabling audit of which IAM actions an program actually needs.

  The hooks API is currently experimental, and may change in a later version. Full details and examples are in the `Amazonka.Env.Hooks` module.

- The authentication code in `amazonka` got a full rewrite in PR [\#746](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/746).

  - On Windows, the {credential,config} files are read from `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\{credentials,config}` to [match the AWS SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/creds-file.html#creds-file-general-info).
  - `newEnv` now takes a function of type `EnvNoAuth -> m Env`, which is to fetch credentials in an appropriate manner
  - The `Credentials` type has been removed, you should instead use the following functions corresponding to the departed constructor. All are exported by `Amazonka.Auth`:

    | Old Name          | New Name                     | Args/Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

    | `FromKeys`        | `fromKeys`                   | `AccessKey`, `SecretKey`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
    | `FromSession`     | `fromSession`                | `AccessKey`, `SecretKey`, `SessionToken`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
    |                   | `fromTemporarySession`       | `AccessKey`, `SecretKey`, `SessionToken`, `UTCTime` (expiry time). Likely not useful.                                                                                                                                                                   |
    |                   | `fromKeysEnv`                | None - reads `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and optionally `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.                                                                                                                                                          |
    | `FromEnv`         |                              | Removed - look up named environment variables for access key id/secret access key/session token/expiry time.                                                                                                                                            |
    | `FromProfile`     | `fromNamedInstanceProfile`   | `Text` - looks up a named instance profile from the Instance Meta-Data Service (IMDS).                                                                                                                                                                  |
    |                   | `fromDefaultInstanceProfile` | None - selects the first instance profile, like the `discover` process does as one of its steps.                                                                                                                                                        |
    | `FromFile`        | `fromFilePath`               | `Text` (profile name), `FilePath` (credentials file), `FilePath` (config file). **Significantly improved** - now respects the `role_arn` setting in config files, alongside either `source_profile`, `credential_source`, or `web_identity_token_file`. |
    |                   | `fromFileEnv`                | None - read config files from their default location, and respects the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.                                                                                                                                              |
    |                   | `fromAssumedRole`            | `Text` (role arn), `Text` (role session name).

    | `Discover`        | `discover`                   | A rough mimic of the offical SDK, trying several methods in sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

  - The `Amazonka.Auth.runCredentialChain` function allows you to build your own custom credential chains.

- Select parts of `amazonka-core:Amazonka.Data` are now re-exported from `amazonka-core:Amazonka.Core` (and by extension, `amazonka:Amazonka`), instead of the entire module. [\#851](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/851).

  - In particular, serialisation classes and helpers are no longer exported, and service bindings import `Amazonka.Data` directly.
  - Most library users should see little difference, but the `ToText` and `ToByteString` classes are no longer exported by default.

- Records within the `amazonka-core` and `amazonka` libraries no longer have (inconsistent) leading underscores or prefixes [\#844](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/844). A few other functions were renamed/removed for consistency or to avoid name clashes:

  - `Amazonka.Env.envAuthMaybe` -> `Amazonka.authMaybe` (and its re-export from `Amazonka`)
  - `Amazonka.Env.configure` -> `Amazonka.Env.configureService` (and its re-export from `Amazonka`)
  - `Amazonka.Env.override` -> `Amazonka.Env.overrideService` (and its re-export from `Amazonka`)
  - `Amazonka.Env.timeout` -> `Amazonka.Env.globalTimeout` (and its re-export from `Amazonka`)
  - `Amazonka.Env.within`: removed; it was merely a record update
  - `Amazonka.Body._Body`: removed.

  As with record fields in generated bindings, you should use record updates, generic lenses/optics, or `-XOverloadedRecordDot`. However, if you prefer explicit lenses, prefixed lenses are available where the records are defined, and are colleced in the `Amazonka.Core.Lens` and `Amazonka.Lens` modules (`Amazonka.Lens` re-exports `Amazonka.Core.Lens`).

## [2.0.0 RC1](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/tree/2.0.0-rc1)
Released: **28nd November, 2021**, Compare: [1.6.1](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/compare/1.6.1...2.0.0-rc1)

### Major Changes

- Every service has been regenerated.

- Enums (sum types) have been replaced with pattern synonyms. (Thanks @rossabaker)
  - This reduces GHC memory usage on some large packages (notably `amazonka-ec2`), as well as makes them more robust against new enum values in regions, responses, etc.

- Naming
  - Record smart constructors (previously `describeInstances`, `getObject`, etc.) are now strictly prefixed with `new`, such as `newDescribeInstances`.
  - Record fields are no longer prefixed and are fully exported.
  - Generated lenses are no longer exported from the top-level `Amazonka.<name>` module - instead a `Amazonka.<name>.Lens` module is provided for backwards compatibility. These lenses may be deprecated in future.
  - Generated lenses no longer use mnemonic or heuristically assigned prefixes such as `dirsrsInstances` and instead strictly prefix using the type name `describeInstances_instances` - following the form `<type>_<field>`.
  - A library such as [`generic-lens`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens) or [`optics`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics) can be used with the type's `Generic` instance for more succinct lenses that match the record field name or AWS documentation.

- Exports
  - The `amazonka` package now re-exports modules from `amazonka-core` such as `Amazonka.Data`, `Amazonka.Types`.
  - All generated datatype constructors are fully exported. The datatype constructor is strictly prime suffixed, so for a given type `data <type> = <type>'`.

- CI
  - Nix, Bazel, and GitHub Actions are used for CI.
  - CPP supporting GHC < 8.8 has been removed.
  - While GHC 8.6 is not in the CI matrix, it currently builds, so packages depend on `base >= 4.12`.

- The `AWST` transformer from `Control.Monad.Trans.AWS` and its related instances has been removed. Functions such as `send` and `paginate` now universally take an `Env` as their first argument, so you can build your own transformer, or use your preferred effects system.

- Namespace
  - The core `Network.AWS` namespace has been renamed to `Amazonka`, which now matches the package name. A simple search and replace on your codebase should be sufficient for migration:

```
perl -pi -e 's/Network\.AWS/Amazonka/g' `find . -type f -name '*.hs'`
```

### Fixed

- `aeson ^>= 1.5` and `aeson ^>= 2.0` are now supported.
[\#713](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/pull/713)
- The `Credentials` type has a new `FromWebIdentity` constructor. Thank you to Mateusz Kowalczyk (@Fuuzetsu) and Oleg (@K0Te) for the initial implementation.
