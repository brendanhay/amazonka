    --
    -- -   __@ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED@__ - Lightsail requires
    --     additional information to process this certificate request. This can
    --     happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when the domain ranks
    --     within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To provide the required
    --     information, use the
    --     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home Amazon Web Services Support Center>
    --     to contact Amazon Web Services Support.
    --
    --     You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such
    --     as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or
    --     elasticbeanstalk.com.
    --
    -- -   __@DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED@__ - One or more of the domain names in the
    --     certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by
    --     <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url VirusTotal>. To correct the
    --     problem, search for your domain name on the
    --     <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/url VirusTotal> website. If
    --     your domain is reported as suspicious, see
    --     <https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked Google Help for Hacked Websites>
    --     to learn what you can do.
    --
    --     If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the
    --     organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an
    --     aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove
    --     your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the problem
    --     and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a new
    --     certificate.
    --
    --     If you see this error and your domain is not included in the
    --     VirusTotal list, visit the
    --     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home Amazon Web Services Support Center>
    --     and create a case.
    --
    -- -   __@INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN@__ - One or more of the domain names in the
    --     certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is because a
    --     domain name in the request is not a valid top-level domain. Try to
    --     request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos
    --     that were in the failed request, and ensure that all domain names in
    --     the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you cannot
    --     request a certificate for @example.invalidpublicdomain@ because
    --     @invalidpublicdomain@ is not a valid top-level domain.
    --
    -- -   __@OTHER@__ - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a
    --     typographical error in one or more of the domain names in the
    --     certificate request. Try to request a certificate again, correcting
    --     any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request.
