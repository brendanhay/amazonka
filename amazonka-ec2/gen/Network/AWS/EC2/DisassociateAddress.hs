-- Disassociates an Elastic IP address from the instance or network
-- interface it\'s associated with.
--
-- An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or
-- in a VPC. For more information, see

-- in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/.
--
-- This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than
-- once, Amazon EC2 doesn\'t return an error.
