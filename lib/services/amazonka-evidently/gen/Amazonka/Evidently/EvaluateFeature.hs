--
-- This operation assigns a feature variation to one given user session.
-- You pass in an @entityID@ that represents the user. Evidently then
-- checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation.
--
-- The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the
-- user\'s @entityID@ matches an override rule, the user is served the
-- variation specified by that rule.
--
-- If there is a current launch with this feature that uses segment
-- overrides, and if the user session\'s @evaluationContext@ matches a
-- segment rule defined in a segment override, the configuration in the
-- segment overrides is used. For more information about segments, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSegment.html CreateSegment>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html Use segments to focus your audience>.
--
-- If there is a launch with no segment overrides, the user might be
-- assigned to a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the
-- percentage of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is
-- enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the
-- allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch.
--
-- If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing
-- experiment for this feature, the user might be assigned to a variation
-- in the experiment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users
-- that are allocated to that experiment.
--
-- If the experiment uses a segment, then only user sessions with
-- @evaluationContext@ values that match the segment rule are used in the
-- experiment.
--
-- If the user is enrolled in the experiment, the variation they are served
-- depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the
-- experiment.
--
-- If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served
-- the default variation.
