--
-- @BatchMeterUsage@ is called from a SaaS application listed on AWS
-- Marketplace to post metering records for a set of customers.
--
-- For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried
-- with the same records or a subset of the input records.
--
-- Every request to @BatchMeterUsage@ is for one product. If you need to
-- meter usage for multiple products, you must make multiple calls to
-- @BatchMeterUsage@.
--
-- Usage records are expected to be submitted as quickly as possible after
-- the event that is being recorded, and are not accepted more than 6 hours
-- after the event.
--
-- @BatchMeterUsage@ can process up to 25 @UsageRecords@ at a time.
--
-- A @UsageRecord@ can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to
-- provide customers with usage data split into buckets by tags that you
-- define (or allow the customer to define).
--
-- @BatchMeterUsage@ returns a list of @UsageRecordResult@ objects, showing
-- the result for each @UsageRecord@, as well as a list of
-- @UnprocessedRecords@, indicating errors in the service side that you
-- should retry.
--
-- @BatchMeterUsage@ requests must be less than 1MB in size.
--
-- For an example of using @BatchMeterUsage@, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-code-examples.html#saas-batchmeterusage-example BatchMeterUsage code example>
-- in the /AWS Marketplace Seller Guide/.
