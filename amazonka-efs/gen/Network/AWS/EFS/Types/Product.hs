-- | Creates a value of 'FileSystemDescription' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'fsdEncrypted' - A boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is encrypted.
--
-- * 'fsdKMSKeyId' - The id of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was used to protect the encrypted file system.
--
-- * 'fsdName' - You can add tags to a file system, including a @Name@ tag. For more information, see 'CreateTags' . If the file system has a @Name@ tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.
--
-- * 'fsdOwnerId' - AWS account that created the file system. If the file system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to which the user belongs is the owner.
--
-- * 'fsdCreationToken' - Opaque string specified in the request.
--
-- * 'fsdFileSystemId' - ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.
--
-- * 'fsdCreationTime' - Time that the file system was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).
--
-- * 'fsdLifeCycleState' - Lifecycle phase of the file system.
--
-- * 'fsdNumberOfMountTargets' - Current number of mount targets that the file system has. For more information, see 'CreateMountTarget' .
--
-- * 'fsdSizeInBytes' - Latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in bytes, in its @Value@ field, and the time at which that size was determined in its @Timestamp@ field. The @Timestamp@ value is the integer number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. Note that the value does not represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system. That is, the value will represent actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size the file system was at any instant in time.
--
-- * 'fsdPerformanceMode' - The @PerformanceMode@ of the file system.
