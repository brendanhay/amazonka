-- Running @PutPermission@ permits the specified AWS account to put events to your account's default /event bus/ . CloudWatch Events rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to your default event bus.
--
--
-- For another account to send events to your account, that external account must have a CloudWatch Events rule with your account's default event bus as a target.
--
-- To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your default event bus, run @PutPermission@ once for each of these accounts.

-- | Creates a value of 'PutPermission' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ppAction' - The action that you are enabling the other account to perform. Currently, this must be @events:PutEvents@ .
--
-- * 'ppPrincipal' - The 12-digit AWS account ID that you are permitting to put events to your default event bus. Specify "*" to permit any account to put events to your default event bus. If you specify "*", avoid creating rules that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event pattern for each rule contains an @account@ field with a specific account ID from which to receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other accounts.
--
-- * 'ppStatementId' - An identifier string for the external account that you are granting permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account, specify this @StatementId@ when you run 'RemovePermission' .
