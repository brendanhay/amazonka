-- | Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quantization within
-- each frame based on spatial variation of content complexity. When you
-- enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can
-- sustain more distortion with no noticeable visual degradation and uses
-- more bits on areas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
-- example, complex textured blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth
-- textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature will
-- almost always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this
-- feature doesn\'t take into account where the viewer\'s attention is
-- likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
-- part of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you might choose to
-- disable this feature. Related setting: When you enable spatial adaptive
-- quantization, set the value for Adaptive quantization
-- (adaptiveQuantization) depending on your content. For homogeneous
-- content, such as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For content
-- with a wider variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.
