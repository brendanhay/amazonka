## Description

Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration Service

Use the Amazon Elasticsearch configuration API to create, configure, and
manage Elasticsearch domains.

The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific:
es./region/.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For
a current list of supported regions and endpoints, see
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region Regions and Endpoints>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticsearch)
and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
