-- Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
-- custom matchmaking rules. With games that use Amazon GameLift managed
-- hosting, this operation also triggers Amazon GameLift to find hosting
-- resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each
-- matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and
-- specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for
-- multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all
-- players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding
-- additional players as needed to fill the match.
--
-- To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
-- configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also
-- include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking
-- configuration\'s rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is
-- returned with status set to @QUEUED@.
--
-- Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session
-- connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status
-- updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple
-- Notification Service, which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.
