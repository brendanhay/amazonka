-- | A fleet location and its life-cycle state. A location state object might
-- be used to describe a fleet\'s remote location or home Region.
-- Life-cycle state tracks the progress of launching the first instance in
-- a new location and preparing it for game hosting, and then removing all
-- instances and deleting the location from the fleet.
--
-- -   __NEW__ -- A new fleet location has been defined and desired
--     instances is set to 1.
--
-- -   __DOWNLOADING\/VALIDATING\/BUILDING\/ACTIVATING__ -- Amazon GameLift
--     is setting up the new fleet location, creating new instances with
--     the game build or Realtime script and starting server processes.
--
-- -   __ACTIVE__ -- Hosts can now accept game sessions.
--
-- -   __ERROR__ -- An error occurred when downloading, validating,
--     building, or activating the fleet location.
--
-- -   __DELETING__ -- Hosts are responding to a delete fleet location
--     request.
--
-- -   __TERMINATED__ -- The fleet location no longer exists.
--
-- -   __NOT_FOUND__ -- The fleet location was not found. This could be
--     because the custom location was removed or not created.
--
-- /See:/ 'newLocationState' smart constructor.
