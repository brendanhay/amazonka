-- | The segmentation style parameter controls how segmentation markers are
-- inserted into the transport stream. With avails, it is possible that
-- segments may be truncated, which can influence where future segmentation
-- markers are inserted. When a segmentation style of \"reset_cadence\" is
-- selected and a segment is truncated due to an avail, we will reset the
-- segmentation cadence. This means the subsequent segment will have a
-- duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a segmentation style of
-- \"maintain_cadence\" is selected and a segment is truncated due to an
-- avail, we will not reset the segmentation cadence. This means the
-- subsequent segment will likely be truncated as well. However, all
-- segments after that will have a duration of $segmentation_time seconds.
-- Note that EBP lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.
