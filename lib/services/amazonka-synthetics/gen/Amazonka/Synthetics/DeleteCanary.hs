-- Permanently deletes the specified canary.
--
-- If you specify @DeleteLambda@ to @true@, CloudWatch Synthetics also
-- deletes the Lambda functions and layers that are used by the canary.
--
-- Other resources used and created by the canary are not automatically
-- deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again,
-- you should also delete the following:
--
-- -   The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a
--     name of @Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-@/@MyCanaryName@/@ @.
--
-- -   Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary\'s artifact
--     location.
--
-- -   IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the
--     console, these roles have the name
--     @ role\/service-role\/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-@/@MyCanaryName@/@ @.
--
-- -   CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups
--     have the name @\/aws\/lambda\/cwsyn-@/@MyCanaryName@/@ @.
--
-- Before you delete a canary, you might want to use @GetCanary@ to display
-- the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned
-- by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you
-- delete the canary.
