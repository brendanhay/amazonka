-- Creates a new version of the bot based on the @> LATEST@ version. If the @> LATEST@ version of this resource hasn't changed since you created the last version, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last created version.
--
--
-- When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see 'versioning-intro' .
--
-- This operation requires permission for the @lex:CreateBotVersion@ action.

--
-- * 'cbvrsFailureReason' - If @status@ is @FAILED@ , Amazon Lex provides the reason that it failed to build the bot.
--
-- * 'cbvrsStatus' - When you send a request to create or update a bot, Amazon Lex sets the @status@ response element to @BUILDING@ . After Amazon Lex builds the bot, it sets @status@ to @READY@ .
