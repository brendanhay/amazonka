--
-- Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a
-- delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there
-- isn\'t a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will
-- still respond that the command was successful.
--
-- To remove a specific version, you must use the version Id subresource.
-- Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object
-- deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header,
-- @x-amz-delete-marker@, to true.
--
-- If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket
-- versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the
-- @x-amz-mfa@ request header in the DELETE @versionId@ request. Requests
-- that include @x-amz-mfa@ must use HTTPS.
--
-- For more information about MFA Delete, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html Using MFA Delete>.
-- To see sample requests that use versioning, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete Sample Request>.
--
-- You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure
-- its lifecycle
-- (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html PutBucketLifecycle>)
-- to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users
-- or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must
-- deny them the @s3:DeleteObject@, @s3:DeleteObjectVersion@, and
-- @s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration@ actions.
--
-- The following action is related to @DeleteObject@:
