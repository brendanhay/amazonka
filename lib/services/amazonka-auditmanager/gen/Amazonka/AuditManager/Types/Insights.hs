-- | A summary of the latest analytics data for all your active assessments.
--
-- This summary is a snapshot of the data that your active assessments
-- collected on the @lastUpdated@ date. It’s important to understand that
-- the following totals are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a
-- total sum to date.
--
-- The @Insights@ data is eventually consistent. This means that, when you
-- read data from @Insights@, the response might not instantly reflect the
-- results of a recently completed write or update operation. If you repeat
-- your read request after a few hours, the response should return the
-- latest data.
--
-- If you delete an assessment or change its status to inactive,
-- @InsightsByAssessment@ includes data for that assessment as follows.
--
-- -   __Inactive assessments__ - If Audit Manager collected evidence for
--     your assessment before you changed it inactive, that evidence is
--     included in the @InsightsByAssessment@ counts for that day.
--
-- -   __Deleted assessments__ - If Audit Manager collected evidence for
--     your assessment before you deleted it, that evidence isn\'t included
--     in the @InsightsByAssessment@ counts for that day.
--
