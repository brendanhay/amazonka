## Description

AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable.
One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct
Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual
interfaces directly to the AWS cloud and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud,
bypassing Internet service providers in your network path.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-directconnect)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
