--
-- Modifies the desired count, deployment configuration, or task definition used in a service.
--
-- You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new 'desiredCount' parameter.
--
-- You can use < UpdateService> to modify your task definition and deploy a new version of your service.
--
-- You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, 'minimumHealthyPercent' and 'maximumPercent', to determine the deployment strategy.
--
-- If the 'minimumHealthyPercent' is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore the 'desiredCount' temporarily during a deployment. For example, if your service has a 'desiredCount' of four tasks, a 'minimumHealthyPercent' of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that /do not/ use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the 'RUNNING' state; tasks for services that /do/ use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the 'RUNNING' state and the container instance it is hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
--
-- The 'maximumPercent' parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a 'desiredCount' of four tasks, a 'maximumPercent' value of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).
--
-- When < UpdateService> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of 'docker stop' is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a 'SIGTERM' and a 30-second timeout, after which 'SIGKILL' is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the 'SIGTERM' gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no 'SIGKILL' is sent.
--
-- When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it attempts to balance them across the Availability Zones in your cluster with the following logic:
--
-- -   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service\'s task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
--
-- -   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
--
-- -   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.
