-- Returns a list of tasks for a specified cluster. You can filter the
-- results by family name, by a particular container instance, or by the
-- desired status of the task with the @family@, @containerInstance@, and
-- @desiredStatus@ parameters.
--
-- Recently stopped tasks might appear in the returned results. Currently,
-- stopped tasks appear in the returned results for at least one hour.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
