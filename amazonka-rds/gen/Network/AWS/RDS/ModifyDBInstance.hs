-- | Creates a value of 'ModifyDBInstance' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mdiEngineVersion' - The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request.  For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family. For a list of valid engine versions, see 'CreateDBInstance' .
--
-- * 'mdiDBSecurityGroups' - A list of DB security groups to authorize on this DB instance. Changing this setting does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Constraints:     * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters     * First character must be a letter     * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
--
-- * 'mdiDBPortNumber' - The port number on which the database accepts connections. The value of the @DBPortNumber@ parameter must not match any of the port values specified for options in the option group for the DB instance. Your database will restart when you change the @DBPortNumber@ value regardless of the value of the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter. __MySQL__  Default: @3306@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@  __MariaDB__  Default: @3306@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@  __PostgreSQL__  Default: @5432@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@  Type: Integer __Oracle__  Default: @1521@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@  __SQL Server__  Default: @1433@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@ except for @1434@ , @3389@ , @47001@ , @49152@ , and @49152@ through @49156@ .  __Amazon Aurora__  Default: @3306@  Valid Values: @1150-65535@
--
-- * 'mdiMasterUserPassword' - The new password for the master user. Can be any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@". Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the @MasterUserPassword@ element exists in the @PendingModifiedValues@ element of the operation response.  __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The password for the master user is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' . Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Must be 8 to 41 alphanumeric characters (MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora), 8 to 30 alphanumeric characters (Oracle), or 8 to 128 alphanumeric characters (SQL Server).
--
-- * 'mdiPubliclyAccessible' - Boolean value that indicates if the DB instance has a publicly resolvable DNS name. Set to @True@ to make the DB instance Internet-facing with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. Set to @False@ to make the DB instance internal with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.  @PubliclyAccessible@ only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and @PubliclyAccessible@ must be true in order for it to be publicly accessible.  Changes to the @PubliclyAccessible@ parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter. Default: false
--
-- * 'mdiAutoMinorVersionUpgrade' - Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this parameter is set to @true@ during the maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and RDS has enabled auto patching for that engine version.
--
-- * 'mdiDBSubnetGroupName' - The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance is not in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC Updating the VPC for a DB Instance> .  Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify @true@ for the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter.  Constraints: Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, spaces, or hyphens. Example: @mySubnetGroup@
--
-- * 'mdiMonitoringRoleARN' - The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to CloudWatch Logs. For example, @arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess@ . For information on creating a monitoring role, go to <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html#USER_Monitoring.OS.IAMRole To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring> . If @MonitoringInterval@ is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a @MonitoringRoleArn@ value.
--
-- * 'mdiIOPS' - The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance. Changing this setting does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request.  Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect. __SQL Server__  Setting the IOPS value for the SQL Server database engine is not supported. Type: Integer If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance will be available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance will be suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a Read Replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.
--
-- * 'mdiAllowMajorVersionUpgrade' - Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Constraints: This parameter must be set to true when specifying a value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major version than the DB instance's current version.
--
-- * 'mdiNewDBInstanceIdentifier' - The new DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance reboot will occur immediately if you set @Apply Immediately@ to true, or will occur during the next maintenance window if @Apply Immediately@ to false. This value is stored as a lowercase string.  Constraints:     * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens     * First character must be a letter     * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
--
-- * 'mdiDomain' - The Active Directory Domain to move the instance to. Specify @none@ to remove the instance from its current domain. The domain must be created prior to this operation. Currently only a Microsoft SQL Server instance can be created in a Active Directory Domain.
--
-- * 'mdiMonitoringInterval' - The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If @MonitoringRoleArn@ is specified, then you must also set @MonitoringInterval@ to a value other than 0. Valid Values: @0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60@
--
-- * 'mdiTDECredentialPassword' - The password for the given ARN from the Key Store in order to access the device.
--
-- * 'mdiDBInstanceClass' - The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance. To determine the instance classes that are available for a particular DB engine, use the 'DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions' action. Note that not all instance classes are available in all regions for all DB engines.  Passing a value for this setting causes an outage during the change and is applied during the next maintenance window, unless @ApplyImmediately@ is specified as @true@ for this request.  Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values: @db.t1.micro | db.m1.small | db.m1.medium | db.m1.large | db.m1.xlarge | db.m2.xlarge | db.m2.2xlarge | db.m2.4xlarge | db.m3.medium | db.m3.large | db.m3.xlarge | db.m3.2xlarge | db.m4.large | db.m4.xlarge | db.m4.2xlarge | db.m4.4xlarge | db.m4.10xlarge | db.r3.large | db.r3.xlarge | db.r3.2xlarge | db.r3.4xlarge | db.r3.8xlarge | db.t2.micro | db.t2.small | db.t2.medium | db.t2.large@
--
-- * 'mdiPromotionTier' - A value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.Managing.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster> .  Default: 1 Valid Values: 0 - 15
--
-- * 'mdiLicenseModel' - The license model for the DB instance. Valid values: @license-included@ | @bring-your-own-license@ | @general-public-license@
--
-- * 'mdiPreferredMaintenanceWindow' - The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied. Default: Uses existing setting Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes
--
-- * 'mdiCACertificateIdentifier' - Indicates the certificate that needs to be associated with the instance.
--
-- * 'mdiDBParameterGroupName' - The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance. Changing this setting does not result in an outage. The parameter group name itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter changes are not applied until you reboot the instance without failover. The db instance will NOT be rebooted automatically and the parameter changes will NOT be applied during the next maintenance window. Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter group family as this DB instance.
--
-- * 'mdiPreferredBackupWindow' - The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the @BackupRetentionPeriod@ parameter. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' . Constraints:     * Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi     * Times should be in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)     * Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window     * Must be at least 30 minutes
--
-- * 'mdiBackupRetentionPeriod' - The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups. Changing this parameter can result in an outage if you change from 0 to a non-zero value or from a non-zero value to 0. These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request. If you change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' . Default: Uses existing setting Constraints:     * Must be a value from 0 to 35     * Can be specified for a MySQL Read Replica only if the source is running MySQL 5.6     * Can be specified for a PostgreSQL Read Replica only if the source is running PostgreSQL 9.3.5     * Cannot be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to Read Replicas
--
-- * 'mdiVPCSecurityGroupIds' - A list of EC2 VPC security groups to authorize on this DB instance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' . Constraints:     * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters     * First character must be a letter     * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
--
-- * 'mdiMultiAZ' - Specifies if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request.  Constraints: Cannot be specified if the DB instance is a Read Replica.
--
-- * 'mdiAllocatedStorage' - The new storage capacity of the RDS instance. Changing this setting does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless @ApplyImmediately@ is set to @true@ for this request.  __MySQL__  Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values: 5-6144 Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. Type: Integer __MariaDB__  Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values: 5-6144 Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. Type: Integer __PostgreSQL__  Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values: 5-6144 Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. Type: Integer __Oracle__  Default: Uses existing setting Valid Values: 10-6144 Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. __SQL Server__  Cannot be modified. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance will be available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance will be suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a Read Replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.
--
-- * 'mdiApplyImmediately' - Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the @PreferredMaintenanceWindow@ setting for the DB instance.  If this parameter is set to @false@ , changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and will be applied on the next call to 'RebootDBInstance' , or the next failure reboot. Review the table of parameters in <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html Modifying a DB Instance and Using the Apply Immediately Parameter> to see the impact that setting @ApplyImmediately@ to @true@ or @false@ has for each modified parameter and to determine when the changes will be applied.  Default: @false@
--
-- * 'mdiOptionGroupName' - Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.  Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, cannot be removed from an option group, and that option group cannot be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance
--
-- * 'mdiCopyTagsToSnapshot' - True to copy all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB instance; otherwise false. The default is false.
--
-- * 'mdiTDECredentialARN' - The ARN from the Key Store with which to associate the instance for TDE encryption.
--
-- * 'mdiDomainIAMRoleName' - The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the Directory Service.
--
-- * 'mdiEnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication' - True to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts; otherwise false. You can enable IAM database authentication for the following database engines __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. Mapping AWS IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' . __MySQL__      * For MySQL 5.6, minor version 5.6.34 or higher     * For MySQL 5.7, minor version 5.7.16 or higher Default: @false@
--
-- * 'mdiStorageType' - Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance. Valid values: @standard | gp2 | io1@  If you specify @io1@ , you must also include a value for the @Iops@ parameter.  Default: @io1@ if the @Iops@ parameter is specified; otherwise @standard@
--
-- * 'mdiDBInstanceIdentifier' - The DB instance identifier. This value is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints:     * Must be the identifier for an existing DB instance     * Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens     * First character must be a letter     * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

-- | Boolean value that indicates if the DB instance has a publicly resolvable DNS name. Set to @True@ to make the DB instance Internet-facing with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. Set to @False@ to make the DB instance internal with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.  @PubliclyAccessible@ only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a public subnet and @PubliclyAccessible@ must be true in order for it to be publicly accessible.  Changes to the @PubliclyAccessible@ parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter. Default: false
mdiPubliclyAccessible :: Lens' ModifyDBInstance (Maybe Bool)
mdiPubliclyAccessible = lens _mdiPubliclyAccessible (\ s a -> s{_mdiPubliclyAccessible = a});

-- | Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this parameter is set to @true@ during the maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and RDS has enabled auto patching for that engine version.
mdiAutoMinorVersionUpgrade :: Lens' ModifyDBInstance (Maybe Bool)
mdiAutoMinorVersionUpgrade = lens _mdiAutoMinorVersionUpgrade (\ s a -> s{_mdiAutoMinorVersionUpgrade = a});

-- | The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this parameter to move your DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB instance is not in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move your DB instance into a VPC. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Non-VPC2VPC Updating the VPC for a DB Instance> .  Changing the subnet group causes an outage during the change. The change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you specify @true@ for the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter.  Constraints: Must contain no more than 255 alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores, spaces, or hyphens. Example: @mySubnetGroup@

-- | The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance. Changing this setting does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request.  Default: Uses existing setting Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0. The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect. __SQL Server__  Setting the IOPS value for the SQL Server database engine is not supported. Type: Integer If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance will be available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance will be suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a Read Replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

mdiPreferredBackupWindow = lens _mdiPreferredBackupWindow (\ s a -> s{_mdiPreferredBackupWindow = a});

-- | The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables automated backups. Changing this parameter can result in an outage if you change from 0 to a non-zero value or from a non-zero value to 0. These changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless the @ApplyImmediately@ parameter is set to @true@ for this request. If you change the parameter from one non-zero value to another non-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. __Amazon Aurora__  Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see 'ModifyDBCluster' .
