-- | Describes an instance fleet, which is a group of Amazon EC2 instances
-- that host a particular node type (master, core, or task) in an Amazon
-- EMR cluster. Instance fleets can consist of a mix of instance types and
-- On-Demand and Spot Instances, which are provisioned to meet a defined
-- target capacity.

-- The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR
-- releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.
