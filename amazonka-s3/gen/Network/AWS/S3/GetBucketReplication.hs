-- Returns the replication configuration of a bucket.
--
-- It can take a while to propagate the put or delete a replication
-- configuration to all Amazon S3 systems. Therefore, a get request soon
-- after put or delete can return a wrong result.
--
-- For information about replication configuration, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- This operation requires permissions for the
-- @s3:GetReplicationConfiguration@ action. For more information about
-- permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html Using Bucket Policies and User Policies>.
--
-- If you include the @Filter@ element in a replication configuration, you
-- must also include the @DeleteMarkerReplication@ and @Priority@ elements.
-- The response also returns those elements.
--
-- For information about @GetBucketReplication@ errors, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ReplicationErrorCodeList List of replication-related error codes>

-- The following operations are related to @GetBucketReplication@:
