-- Describes events for a specified server. Results are ordered by time,
-- with newest events first.
--
-- This operation is synchronous.
--
-- A @ResourceNotFoundException@ is thrown when the server does not exist.
-- A @ValidationException@ is raised when parameters of the request are not
-- valid.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
