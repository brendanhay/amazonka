## Description

Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy
for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data,
and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your
keys. Amazon Key Management Service is integrated with other Amazon services
including Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. Amazon Key Management
Service is also integrated with Amazon CloudTrail to provide you with logs of
all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kms)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
