-- Deletes the replication configuration from the bucket.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
-- @s3:PutReplicationConfiguration@ action. The bucket owner has these
-- permissions by default and can grant it to others. For more information
-- about permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources>.
--
-- It can take a while for the deletion of a replication configuration to
-- fully propagate.
--
-- For information about replication configuration, see
-- <%20https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html Replication>
-- in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/.
