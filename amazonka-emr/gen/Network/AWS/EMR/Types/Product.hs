-- | An application is any Amazon or third-party software that you can add to the cluster. This structure contains a list of strings that indicates the software to use with the cluster and accepts a user argument list. Amazon EMR accepts and forwards the argument list to the corresponding installation script as bootstrap action argument. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-mapr.html Using the MapR Distribution for Hadoop> . Currently supported values are:
--
--
--     * "mapr-m3" - launch the cluster using MapR M3 Edition.
--
--     * "mapr-m5" - launch the cluster using MapR M5 Edition.
--
--     * "mapr" with the user arguments specifying "--edition,m3" or "--edition,m5" - launch the cluster using MapR M3 or M5 Edition, respectively.

-- * 'cluEBSRootVolumeSize' - The size, in GiB, of the EBS root device volume of the Linux AMI that is used for each EC2 instance. Available in Amazon EMR version 4.x and later.
--
-- * 'cluEC2InstanceAttributes' - Provides information about the EC2 instances in a cluster grouped by category. For example, key name, subnet ID, IAM instance profile, and so on.
--
-- * 'cluNormalizedInstanceHours' - An approximation of the cost of the cluster, represented in m1.small/hours. This value is incremented one time for every hour an m1.small instance runs. Larger instances are weighted more, so an EC2 instance that is roughly four times more expensive would result in the normalized instance hours being incremented by four. This result is only an approximation and does not reflect the actual billing rate.
--
-- * 'cluConfigurations' - Applies only to Amazon EMR releases 4.x and later. The list of Configurations supplied to the EMR cluster.
--
-- * 'cluCustomAMIId' - Available only in Amazon EMR version 5.7.0 and later. The ID of a custom Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI if the cluster uses a custom AMI.
--
-- * 'cluAutoScalingRole' - An IAM role for automatic scaling policies. The default role is @EMR_AutoScaling_DefaultRole@ . The IAM role provides permissions that the automatic scaling feature requires to launch and terminate EC2 instances in an instance group.
--
-- * 'cluSecurityConfiguration' - The name of the security configuration applied to the cluster.
--
-- * 'cluScaleDownBehavior' - The way that individual Amazon EC2 instances terminate when an automatic scale-in activity occurs or an instance group is resized. @TERMINATE_AT_INSTANCE_HOUR@ indicates that Amazon EMR terminates nodes at the instance-hour boundary, regardless of when the request to terminate the instance was submitted. This option is only available with Amazon EMR 5.1.0 and later and is the default for clusters created using that version. @TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION@ indicates that Amazon EMR blacklists and drains tasks from nodes before terminating the Amazon EC2 instances, regardless of the instance-hour boundary. With either behavior, Amazon EMR removes the least active nodes first and blocks instance termination if it could lead to HDFS corruption. @TERMINATE_AT_TASK_COMPLETION@ is available only in Amazon EMR version 4.1.0 and later, and is the default for versions of Amazon EMR earlier than 5.1.0.
--
-- * 'cluInstanceCollectionType' - The instance group configuration of the cluster. A value of @INSTANCE_GROUP@ indicates a uniform instance group configuration. A value of @INSTANCE_FLEET@ indicates an instance fleets configuration.
--
-- * 'cluReleaseLabel' - The release label for the Amazon EMR release.
--
-- * 'cluRepoUpgradeOnBoot' - Applies only when @CustomAmiID@ is used. Specifies the type of updates that are applied from the Amazon Linux AMI package repositories when an instance boots using the AMI.
--
-- * 'cluLogURI' - The path to the Amazon S3 location where logs for this cluster are stored.
--
-- * 'cluRunningAMIVersion' - The AMI version running on this cluster.
--
-- * 'cluMasterPublicDNSName' - The public DNS name of the master EC2 instance.
--
-- * 'cluTerminationProtected' - Indicates whether Amazon EMR will lock the cluster to prevent the EC2 instances from being terminated by an API call or user intervention, or in the event of a cluster error.
--
-- * 'cluVisibleToAllUsers' - Indicates whether the cluster is visible to all IAM users of the AWS account associated with the cluster. If this value is set to @true@ , all IAM users of that AWS account can view and manage the cluster if they have the proper policy permissions set. If this value is @false@ , only the IAM user that created the cluster can view and manage it. This value can be changed using the 'SetVisibleToAllUsers' action.
--
-- * 'cluAutoTerminate' - Specifies whether the cluster should terminate after completing all steps.
--
-- * 'cluApplications' - The applications installed on this cluster.
--
-- * 'cluTags' - A list of tags associated with a cluster.
