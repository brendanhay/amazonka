    -- (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances
    -- are in the @DRAINING@ state if the service contains tasks using the EC2
    -- launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch
    -- size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks
    -- and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new
    -- tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster
