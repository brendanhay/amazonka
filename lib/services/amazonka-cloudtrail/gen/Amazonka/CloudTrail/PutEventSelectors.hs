-- Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail.
-- Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management
-- and data event settings for your trail. If you want your trail to log
-- Insights events, be sure the event selector enables logging of the
-- Insights event types you want configured for your trail. For more
-- information about logging Insights events, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging Insights events for trails>
-- in the /CloudTrail User Guide/. By default, trails created without
-- specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write
-- management events, and no data events.
--
-- When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event
-- selectors or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if
-- the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the
-- event. If the event doesn\'t match any event selector, the trail
-- doesn\'t log the event.
--
-- Example
--
-- 1.  You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want
--     write-only events.
--
-- 2.  The EC2 @GetConsoleOutput@ and @RunInstances@ API operations occur
--     in your account.
--
-- 3.  CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
--
-- 4.  The @RunInstances@ is a write-only event and it matches your event
--     selector. The trail logs the event.
--
-- 5.  The @GetConsoleOutput@ is a read-only event that doesn\'t match your
--     event selector. The trail doesn\'t log the event.
--
-- The @PutEventSelectors@ operation must be called from the Region in
-- which the trail was created; otherwise, an @InvalidHomeRegionException@
-- exception is thrown.
--
-- You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging management events>,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging data events>,
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html Quotas in CloudTrail>
-- in the /CloudTrail User Guide/.
--
-- You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
-- event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and
-- selectors on a trail. You can use either @AdvancedEventSelectors@ or
-- @EventSelectors@, but not both. If you apply @AdvancedEventSelectors@ to
-- a trail, any existing @EventSelectors@ are overwritten. For more
-- information about advanced event selectors, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging data events>
