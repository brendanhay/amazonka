-- Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the
-- group can no longer access documents only available to that group.
--
-- For example, after deleting the group \"Summer Interns\", all interns
-- who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their
-- search results.
--
-- If you want to delete or replace users or sub groups of a group, you
-- need to use the @PutPrincipalMapping@ operation. For example, if a user
-- in the group \"Engineering\" leaves the engineering team and another
-- user takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or sub
-- groups that belong to the \"Engineering\" group when calling
-- @PutPrincipalMapping@. You can update your internal list of users or sub
-- groups and input this list when calling @PutPrincipalMapping@.
--
-- @DeletePrincipalMapping@ is currently not supported in the Amazon Web
-- Services GovCloud (US-West) region.
