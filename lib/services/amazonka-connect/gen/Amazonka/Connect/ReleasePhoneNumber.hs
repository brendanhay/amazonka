--
-- Releases a phone number previously claimed to an Amazon Connect instance
-- or traffic distribution group. You can call this API only in the Amazon
-- Web Services Region where the number was claimed.
--
-- To release phone numbers from a traffic distribution group, use the
-- @ReleasePhoneNumber@ API, not the Amazon Connect console.
--
-- After releasing a phone number, the phone number enters into a cooldown
-- period of 30 days. It cannot be searched for or claimed again until the
-- period has ended. If you accidentally release a phone number, contact
-- Amazon Web Services Support.
--
-- If you plan to claim and release numbers frequently during a 30 day
-- period, contact us for a service quota exception. Otherwise, it is
-- possible you will be blocked from claiming and releasing any more
-- numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired.
--
-- By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum number
-- of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and
-- release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle
-- that exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be
-- blocked from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest
-- number released has expired.
--
-- For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level
-- quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99,
-- claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
-- that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open
-- an Amazon Web Services support ticket.
