--
-- Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting
-- period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days.
-- When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes
-- to @PendingDeletion@ and the key can\'t be used in any cryptographic
-- operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting
-- period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to
-- cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS
-- deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with
-- it, including all aliases that refer to it.
--
-- Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation.
-- When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key
-- is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a
-- <kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html multi-Region replica key>,
-- or an asymmetric or HMAC KMS key with imported key material[BUGBUG-link
-- to importing-keys-managing.html#import-delete-key.) To prevent the use
-- of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.
--
-- You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its
-- replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region
-- primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of
-- a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to
-- @PendingReplicaDeletion@ and it cannot be replicated or used in
-- cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When
-- the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key
-- state of the primary key changes to @PendingDeletion@ and its waiting
-- period (@PendingWindowInDays@) begins. For details, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html Deleting multi-Region keys>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- When KMS
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-cmk-keystore.html deletes a KMS key from an CloudHSM key store>,
-- it makes a best effort to delete the associated key material from the
-- associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key delete the orphaned key material>
-- from the cluster and its backups.
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/delete-xks-key.html Deleting a KMS key from an external key store>
-- has no effect on the associated external key. However, for both types of
-- custom key stores, deleting a KMS key is destructive and irreversible.
-- You cannot decrypt ciphertext encrypted under the KMS key by using only
-- its associated external key or CloudHSM key. Also, you cannot recreate a
-- KMS key in an external key store by creating a new KMS key with the same
-- key material.
--
-- For more information about scheduling a KMS key for deletion, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html Deleting KMS keys>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
-- state. For details, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html Key states of KMS keys>
-- in the /Key Management Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Cross-account use__: No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
-- key in a different Amazon Web Services account.
--
-- __Required permissions__: kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion (key policy)
