-- Use this operation to delete a workforce.
--
-- If you want to create a new workforce in an Amazon Web Services Region
-- where a workforce already exists, use this operation to delete the
-- existing workforce and then use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateWorkforce.html CreateWorkforce>
-- to create a new workforce.
--
-- If a private workforce contains one or more work teams, you must use the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteWorkteam.html DeleteWorkteam>
-- operation to delete all work teams before you delete the workforce. If
-- you try to delete a workforce that contains one or more work teams, you
-- will recieve a @ResourceInUse@ error.
