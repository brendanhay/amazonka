-- Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific AWS service. The
-- service controls the attached policies and when the role can be deleted.
-- This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an unexpectedly
-- changed or deleted role, which could put your AWS resources into an
-- unknown state. Allowing the service to control the role helps improve
-- service stability and proper cleanup when a service and its role are no
-- longer needed. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html Using service-linked roles>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the
-- request using the AWS service that depends on this role.
