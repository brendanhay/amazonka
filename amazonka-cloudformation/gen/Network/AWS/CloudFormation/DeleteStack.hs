-- previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS
-- CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user
-- credentials.

-- 'clientRequestToken', 'deleteStack_clientRequestToken' - A unique identifier for this @DeleteStack@ request. Specify this token
-- if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that
-- you\'re not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might
-- retry @DeleteStack@ requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation
-- successfully received them.
--
-- All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same
