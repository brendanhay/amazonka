    -- __Fleet creation events (ordered by fleet creation activity):__
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATED -- A fleet resource was successfully created with a
    --     status of @NEW@. Event messaging includes the fleet ID.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING -- Fleet status changed from @NEW@ to
    --     @DOWNLOADING@. The compressed build has started downloading to a
    --     fleet instance for installation.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build failed to download to the
    --     fleet instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was
    --     successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now
    --     being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance.
    --     Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to @ACTIVE@
    --     status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are
    --     extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the
    --     URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were
    --     successfully extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the
    --     build\'s install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage
    --     prevents a fleet from moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage
    --     list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed
    --     successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was
    --     successful, and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game
    --     server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet\'s runtime
    --     configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, Amazon
    --     GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the
    --     process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from
    --     moving to @ACTIVE@ status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths
    --     in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found.
    --     Access the logs by using the URL in /PreSignedLogUrl/.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from @DOWNLOADING@ to
    --     @VALIDATING@.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the runtime
    --     configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch
    --     path does not exist on the instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status changed from @VALIDATING@ to
    --     @BUILDING@.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the
    --     runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a
    --     launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet status changed from @BUILDING@ to
    --     @ACTIVATING@.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete
    --     one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code
    --     indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet
    --     instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server

    --     in your AWS account.
    --
    -- -   FLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED -- A requested VPC peering connection has
    --     failed. Event details and status information (see
    --     DescribeVpcPeeringConnections) provide additional detail. A common
    --     reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping
    --     CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR
    --     block for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC

    --
    -- -   FLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED -- A change was
