-- Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a
-- new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds.
-- The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Visibility Timeout>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes.
-- After 3 minutes, you call @ChangeMessageVisibility@ with a timeout of 10
-- minutes. You can continue to call @ChangeMessageVisibility@ to extend
-- the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend
-- the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.
--
-- An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:
--
-- 1.  Sent to a queue by a producer.
--
-- 2.  Received from the queue by a consumer.
--
-- 3.  Deleted from the queue.
--
-- A message is considered to be /stored/ after it is sent to a queue by a
-- producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is,
-- between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored
-- messages. A message is considered to be /in flight/ after it is received
-- from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is,
-- between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight
-- messages.
--
-- Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the /unlimited/
-- number of stored messages.
--
-- For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message
-- backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight
-- messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from
-- the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the @OverLimit@
-- error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages
-- from the queue after they\'re processed. You can also increase the
-- number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit
-- increase,
-- <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sqs file a support request>.
--
-- For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages
-- (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the
-- queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.
--
-- If you attempt to set the @VisibilityTimeout@ to a value greater than
-- the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn\'t
-- automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum
-- remaining time.
--
-- Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a
-- specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn\'t
-- saved in memory for that message. If you don\'t delete a message after
-- it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the
-- original timeout value (not to the value you set using the
-- @ChangeMessageVisibility@ action) the next time the message is received.
