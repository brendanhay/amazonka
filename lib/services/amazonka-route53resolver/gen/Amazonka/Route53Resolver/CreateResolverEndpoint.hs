-- Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints,
-- inbound and outbound:
--
-- -   An /inbound Resolver endpoint/ forwards DNS queries to the DNS
--     service for a VPC from your network.
--
-- -   An /outbound Resolver endpoint/ forwards DNS queries from the DNS
--     service for a VPC to your network.
