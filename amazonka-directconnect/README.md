## Description

AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS
Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and
your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases
can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and
provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
connections.

The AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and
usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS Direct
Connect. Use the following links to get started using the /AWS Direct
Connect API Reference/:

-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html Actions>:
    An alphabetical list of all AWS Direct Connect actions.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html Data Types>:
    An alphabetical list of all AWS Direct Connect data types.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html Common Query Parameters>:
    Parameters that all Query actions can use.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html Common Errors>:
    Client and server errors that all actions can return.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-directconnect)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
