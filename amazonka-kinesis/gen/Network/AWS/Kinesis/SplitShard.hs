--
-- Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to
-- increase the stream\'s capacity to ingest and transport data.
-- @SplitShard@ is called when there is a need to increase the overall
-- capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of
-- data records being ingested.
--
-- You can also use @SplitShard@ when a shard appears to be approaching its
-- maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the
-- specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated.
-- You can also call @SplitShard@ to increase stream capacity, so that more
-- Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the
-- stream for real-time processing.
--
-- You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is
-- the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many
-- cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and ending
-- hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped
-- into the shard. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html Split a Shard>
-- in the /Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide/.
--
-- You can use DescribeStream to determine the shard ID and hash key values
-- for the @ShardToSplit@ and @NewStartingHashKey@ parameters that are
-- specified in the @SplitShard@ request.
--
-- @SplitShard@ is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a @SplitShard@
-- request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets
-- the stream status to @UPDATING@. After the operation is completed,
-- Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to @ACTIVE@. Read and write
-- operations continue to work while the stream is in the @UPDATING@ state.
--
-- You can use @DescribeStream@ to check the status of the stream, which is
-- returned in @StreamStatus@. If the stream is in the @ACTIVE@ state, you
-- can call @SplitShard@. If a stream is in @CREATING@ or @UPDATING@ or
-- @DELETING@ states, @DescribeStream@ returns a @ResourceInUseException@.
--
-- If the specified stream does not exist, @DescribeStream@ returns a
-- @ResourceNotFoundException@. If you try to create more shards than are
-- authorized for your account, you receive a @LimitExceededException@.
--
-- For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html Kinesis Data Streams Limits>
-- in the /Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide/. To increase this
-- limit,
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html contact AWS Support>.
--
-- If you try to operate on too many streams simultaneously using
-- CreateStream, DeleteStream, MergeShards, and\/or SplitShard, you receive
-- a @LimitExceededException@.
--
-- @SplitShard@ has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
