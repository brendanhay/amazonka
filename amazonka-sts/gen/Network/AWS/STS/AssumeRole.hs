--
-- Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
-- access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These
-- temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key,
-- and a security token. Typically, you use @AssumeRole@ within your
-- account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of @AssumeRole@
-- with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html Requesting Temporary Security Credentials>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison Comparing the AWS STS API operations>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You cannot use AWS account root user credentials to call @AssumeRole@.
-- You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call
-- @AssumeRole@.
--
-- For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and
-- need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term
-- credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing
-- all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account
-- can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term
-- credentials in one account. Then use temporary security credentials to
-- access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For
-- more information about roles, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html IAM Roles>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Session Duration__
--
-- By default, the temporary security credentials created by @AssumeRole@
-- last for one hour. However, you can use the optional @DurationSeconds@
-- parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a
-- value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration
-- setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12
-- hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/. The maximum session duration limit applies when
-- you use the @AssumeRole*@ API operations or the @assume-role*@ CLI
-- commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations
-- to create a console URL. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html Using IAM Roles>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Permissions__
--
-- The temporary security credentials created by @AssumeRole@ can be used
-- to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: You
-- cannot call the AWS STS @GetFederationToken@ or @GetSessionToken@ API
-- operations.
--
-- (Optional) You can pass inline or managed
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session session policies>
-- to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
-- an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies
-- to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both
-- inline and managed session policies can\'t exceed 2,048 characters.
-- Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials.
-- The resulting session\'s permissions are the intersection of the role\'s
-- identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role\'s
-- temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in
-- the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
-- more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
-- role that is being assumed. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session Session Policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be
-- trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role\'s
-- trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which
-- accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.
--
-- A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
-- permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The
-- administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
-- @AssumeRole@ for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user
-- is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the
-- following:
--
-- -   Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a
--     different account).
--
-- -   Add the user as a principal directly in the role\'s trust policy.
--
-- In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy.
-- Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to
-- assume the role. For more information about trust policies and
-- resource-based policies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html IAM Policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Tags__
--
-- (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags
-- are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html Passing Session Tags in STS>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
-- session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
-- allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
-- during role chaining. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining Chaining Roles with Session Tags>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Using MFA with AssumeRole__
--
-- (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
-- when you call @AssumeRole@. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
-- to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated
-- with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role
-- being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If
-- the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume
-- the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA
-- authentication might look like the following example.
--
-- @\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}@
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html Configuring MFA-Protected API Access>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/ guide.
--
-- To use MFA with @AssumeRole@, you pass values for the @SerialNumber@ and
-- @TokenCode@ parameters. The @SerialNumber@ value identifies the user\'s
-- hardware or virtual MFA device. The @TokenCode@ is the time-based
-- one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.
