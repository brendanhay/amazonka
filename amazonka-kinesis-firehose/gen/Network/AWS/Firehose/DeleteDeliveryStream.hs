-- Deletes a delivery stream and its data.
--
-- To check the state of a delivery stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream. You
-- can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following
-- states: @ACTIVE@, @DELETING@, @CREATING_FAILED@, or @DELETING_FAILED@.
-- You can\'t delete a delivery stream that is in the @CREATING@ state.
-- While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the
-- @DELETING@ state.
--
-- While the delivery stream is in the @DELETING@ state, the service might
-- continue to accept records, but it doesn\'t make any guarantees with
-- respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first
-- stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a
-- delivery stream.
