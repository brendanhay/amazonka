--
-- Findings for instances include:
--
-- -   __@Underprovisioned@__ —An instance is considered under-provisioned
--     when at least one specification of your instance, such as CPU,
--     memory, or network, does not meet the performance requirements of
--     your workload. Under-provisioned instances may lead to poor
--     application performance.
--
-- -   __@Overprovisioned@__ —An instance is considered over-provisioned
--     when at least one specification of your instance, such as CPU,
--     memory, or network, can be sized down while still meeting the
--     performance requirements of your workload, and no specification is
--     under-provisioned. Over-provisioned instances may lead to
--     unnecessary infrastructure cost.
--
-- -   __@Optimized@__ —An instance is considered optimized when all
--     specifications of your instance, such as CPU, memory, and network,
--     meet the performance requirements of your workload and is not over
--     provisioned. For optimized resources, Compute Optimizer might
--     recommend a new generation instance type.

-- | The reason for the finding classification of the instance.
--
-- Finding reason codes for instances include:
--
-- -   __@CPUOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s CPU configuration can be

--     workload. This is identified by analyzing the @CPUUtilization@
--     metric of the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@CPUUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s CPU configuration
--     doesn\'t meet the performance requirements of your workload and
--     there is an alternative instance type that provides better CPU
--     performance. This is identified by analyzing the @CPUUtilization@
--     metric of the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@MemoryOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s memory configuration
--     can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements
--     of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the memory
--     utilization metric of the current instance during the look-back
--     period.
--
-- -   __@MemoryUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s memory configuration
--     doesn\'t meet the performance requirements of your workload and
--     there is an alternative instance type that provides better memory
--     performance. This is identified by analyzing the memory utilization
--     metric of the current instance during the look-back period.
--
--     Memory utilization is analyzed only for resources that have the
--     unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For more information,
--     see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent Enabling memory utilization with the Amazon CloudWatch Agent>
--     in the /Compute Optimizer User Guide/. On Linux instances, Compute
--     Optimizer analyses the @mem_used_percent@ metric in the @CWAgent@
--     namespace, or the legacy @MemoryUtilization@ metric in the
--     @System\/Linux@ namespace. On Windows instances, Compute Optimizer
--     analyses the @Memory % Committed Bytes In Use@ metric in the
--     @CWAgent@ namespace.
--
-- -   __@EBSThroughputOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s EBS throughput
--     configuration can be sized down while still meeting the performance
--     requirements of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the
--     @VolumeReadBytes@ and @VolumeWriteBytes@ metrics of EBS volumes
--     attached to the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@EBSThroughputUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s EBS throughput
--     configuration doesn\'t meet the performance requirements of your
--     workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides
--     better EBS throughput performance. This is identified by analyzing
--     the @VolumeReadBytes@ and @VolumeWriteBytes@ metrics of EBS volumes
--     attached to the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@EBSIOPSOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s EBS IOPS configuration
--     can be sized down while still meeting the performance requirements
--     of your workload. This is identified by analyzing the
--     @VolumeReadOps@ and @VolumeWriteOps@ metric of EBS volumes attached
--     to the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@EBSIOPSUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s EBS IOPS
--     configuration doesn\'t meet the performance requirements of your
--     workload and there is an alternative instance type that provides
--     better EBS IOPS performance. This is identified by analyzing the
--     @VolumeReadOps@ and @VolumeWriteOps@ metric of EBS volumes attached
--     to the current instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@NetworkBandwidthOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s network
--     bandwidth configuration can be sized down while still meeting the
--     performance requirements of your workload. This is identified by
--     analyzing the @NetworkIn@ and @NetworkOut@ metrics of the current
--     instance during the look-back period.
--
-- -   __@NetworkBandwidthUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s network
--     bandwidth configuration doesn\'t meet the performance requirements
--     of your workload and there is an alternative instance type that
--     provides better network bandwidth performance. This is identified by
--     analyzing the @NetworkIn@ and @NetworkOut@ metrics of the current
--     instance during the look-back period. This finding reason happens
--     when the @NetworkIn@ or @NetworkOut@ performance of an instance is
--     impacted.
--
-- -   __@NetworkPPSOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s network PPS
--     (packets per second) configuration can be sized down while still
--     meeting the performance requirements of your workload. This is
--     identified by analyzing the @NetworkPacketsIn@ and
--     @NetworkPacketsIn@ metrics of the current instance during the
--     look-back period.
--
-- -   __@NetworkPPSUnderprovisioned@__ — The instance’s network PPS
--     (packets per second) configuration doesn\'t meet the performance
--     requirements of your workload and there is an alternative instance
--     type that provides better network PPS performance. This is
--     identified by analyzing the @NetworkPacketsIn@ and
--     @NetworkPacketsIn@ metrics of the current instance during the
--     look-back period.
--
-- -   __@DiskIOPSOverprovisioned@__ — The instance’s disk IOPS
