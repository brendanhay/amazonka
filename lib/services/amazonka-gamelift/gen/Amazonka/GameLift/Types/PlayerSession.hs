-- | Represents a player session. Player sessions are created either for a
-- specific game session, or as part of a game session placement or
-- matchmaking request. A player session can represents a reserved player
-- slot in a game session (when status is @RESERVED@) or actual player
-- activity in a game session (when status is @ACTIVE@). A player session
-- object, including player data, is automatically passed to a game session
-- when the player connects to the game session and is validated. After the
-- game session ends, player sessions information is retained for 30 days
-- and then removed.
