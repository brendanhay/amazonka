-- Use this operation to delete a workforce.
--
-- If you want to create a new workforce in an AWS Region where a workforce
-- already exists, use this operation to delete the existing workforce and
-- then use to create a new workforce.
--
-- If a private workforce contains one or more work teams, you must use the
-- operation to delete all work teams before you delete the workforce. If
-- you try to delete a workforce that contains one or more work teams, you
-- will recieve a @ResourceInUse@ error.
