-- Deletes a traffic policy.
--
-- When you delete a traffic policy, Route 53 sets a flag on the policy to
-- indicate that it has been deleted. However, Route 53 never fully deletes
-- the traffic policy. Note the following:
--
-- -   Deleted traffic policies aren\'t listed if you run
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ListTrafficPolicies.html ListTrafficPolicies>.
--
-- -   There\'s no way to get a list of deleted policies.
--
-- -   If you retain the ID of the policy, you can get information about
--     the policy, including the traffic policy document, by running
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetTrafficPolicy.html GetTrafficPolicy>.
