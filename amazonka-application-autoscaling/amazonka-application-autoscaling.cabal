description:
    Application Auto Scaling is a general purpose Auto Scaling service for
    supported elastic AWS resources. With Application Auto Scaling, you can
    automatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience similar to
    that of Auto Scaling.

    At this time, Application Auto Scaling only supports scaling Amazon ECS
    services.

    For example, you can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the
    following tasks:

    -   Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your
        applicationâ€™s resources

    -   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms

    -   View history of your scaling events
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.ApplicationAutoScaling" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>
    to get started.
