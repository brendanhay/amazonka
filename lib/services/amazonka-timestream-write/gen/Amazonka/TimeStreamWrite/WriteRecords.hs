-- Enables you to write your time-series data into Timestream. You can
-- specify a single data point or a batch of data points to be inserted
-- into the system. Timestream offers you a flexible schema that auto
-- detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based
-- on the dimension names and data types of the data points you specify
-- when invoking writes into the database.
--
-- Timestream supports eventual consistency read semantics. This means that
-- when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into
-- Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of a
-- recently completed write operation. The results may also include some
-- stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the
-- results should return the latest data.
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html Service quotas apply>.

-- for details.
--
-- __Upserts__
--
-- You can use the @Version@ parameter in a @WriteRecords@ request to
-- update data points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record.
-- @Version@ defaults to @1@ when it\'s not specified for the record in the
-- request. Timestream updates an existing record’s measure value along
-- with its @Version@ when it receives a write request with a higher
-- @Version@ number for that record. When it receives an update request
-- where the measure value is the same as that of the existing record,
-- Timestream still updates @Version@, if it is greater than the existing
-- value of @Version@. You can update a data point as many times as
-- desired, as long as the value of @Version@ continuously increases.
--
-- For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating @Version@
-- in the request. Timestream stores this record, and set @Version@ to @1@.
-- Now, suppose you try to update this record with a @WriteRecords@ request
-- of the same record with a different measure value but, like before, do
-- not provide @Version@. In this case, Timestream will reject this update
-- with a @RejectedRecordsException@ since the updated record’s version is
-- not greater than the existing value of Version.
--
-- However, if you were to resend the update request with @Version@ set to
-- @2@, Timestream would then succeed in updating the record’s value, and
-- the @Version@ would be set to @2@. Next, suppose you sent a
-- @WriteRecords@ request with this same record and an identical measure
-- value, but with @Version@ set to @3@. In this case, Timestream would
-- only update @Version@ to @3@. Any further updates would need to send a
-- version number greater than @3@, or the update requests would receive a
-- @RejectedRecordsException@.
