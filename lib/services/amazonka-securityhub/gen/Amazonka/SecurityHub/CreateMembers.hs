--
-- Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified
-- accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the
-- administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then
-- the administrator account is designated by the organization management
-- account.
--
-- @CreateMembers@ is always used to add accounts that are not organization
-- members.
--
-- For accounts that are managed using Organizations, @CreateMembers@ is
-- only used in the following cases:
--
-- -   Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization
--     accounts.
--
-- -   The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.
--
-- This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub
-- enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the @EnableSecurityHub@
-- operation.
--
-- For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account
-- association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send
-- the invitation, you use the @InviteMembers@ operation. If the account
-- owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in
-- Security Hub.
--
-- Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an
-- invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.
--
-- -   If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then
--     Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled.
--     Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the
--     organization management account. The organization management account
--     must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it
--     as a member account.
--
-- -   For organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled,
--     Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It
--     does not change their enabled standards or controls.
--
-- A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to
-- view the findings generated in the member account.
--
-- To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts,
-- use the @DisassociateFromMasterAccount@ or @DisassociateMembers@
-- operation.
