    -- either not specified in the workbook or the format is set to AUTO.
    format :: Prelude.Maybe Format,
    -- | The formatted value of the cell. This is the value that you see
    -- displayed in the cell in the UI.
    --
    -- Note that the formatted value of a cell is always represented as a
    -- string irrespective of the data that is stored in the cell. For example,
    -- if a cell contains a date, the formatted value of the cell is the string
    -- representation of the formatted date being shown in the cell in the UI.
    -- See details in the rawValue field below for how cells of different
    -- formats will have different raw and formatted values.
    formattedValue :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | A list of formatted values of the cell. This field is only returned when
    -- the cell is ROWSET format (aka multi-select or multi-record picklist).
    -- Values in the list are always represented as strings. The formattedValue
    -- field will be empty if this field is returned.
    formattedValues :: Prelude.Maybe [Prelude.Text],
    -- | The formula contained in the cell. This field is empty if a cell does
    -- not have a formula.
    formula :: Prelude.Maybe (Data.Sensitive Prelude.Text),
    -- | The raw value of the data contained in the cell. The raw value depends
    -- on the format of the data in the cell. However the attribute in the API
    -- return value is always a string containing the raw value.
    --
    -- Cells with format DATE, DATE_TIME or TIME have the raw value as a
    -- floating point number where the whole number represents the number of
    -- days since 1\/1\/1900 and the fractional part represents the fraction of
    -- the day since midnight. For example, a cell with date 11\/3\/2020 has
    -- the raw value \"44138\". A cell with the time 9:00 AM has the raw value
    -- \"0.375\" and a cell with date\/time value of 11\/3\/2020 9:00 AM has
    -- the raw value \"44138.375\". Notice that even though the raw value is a
    -- number in all three cases, it is still represented as a string.
    --
    -- Cells with format NUMBER, CURRENCY, PERCENTAGE and ACCOUNTING have the
    -- raw value of the data as the number representing the data being
    -- displayed. For example, the number 1.325 with two decimal places in the
    -- format will have it\'s raw value as \"1.325\" and formatted value as
    -- \"1.33\". A currency value for $10 will have the raw value as \"10\" and
    -- formatted value as \"$10.00\". A value representing 20% with two decimal
    -- places in the format will have its raw value as \"0.2\" and the
    -- formatted value as \"20.00%\". An accounting value of -$25 will have
    -- \"-25\" as the raw value and \"$ (25.00)\" as the formatted value.
    --
    -- Cells with format TEXT will have the raw text as the raw value. For
    -- example, a cell with text \"John Smith\" will have \"John Smith\" as
    -- both the raw value and the formatted value.
    --
    -- Cells with format CONTACT will have the name of the contact as a
    -- formatted value and the email address of the contact as the raw value.
    -- For example, a contact for John Smith will have \"John Smith\" as the
    -- formatted value and \"john.smith\@example.com\" as the raw value.
    --
    -- Cells with format ROWLINK (aka picklist) will have the first column of
    -- the linked row as the formatted value and the row id of the linked row
    -- as the raw value. For example, a cell containing a picklist to a table
    -- that displays task status might have \"Completed\" as the formatted
    -- value and
    -- \"row:dfcefaee-5b37-4355-8f28-40c3e4ff5dd4\/ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03\"
    -- as the raw value.
    --
    -- Cells with format ROWSET (aka multi-select or multi-record picklist)
    -- will by default have the first column of each of the linked rows as the
    -- formatted value in the list, and the rowset id of the linked rows as the
    -- raw value. For example, a cell containing a multi-select picklist to a
    -- table that contains items might have \"Item A\", \"Item B\" in the
    -- formatted value list and \"rows:b742c1f4-6cb0-4650-a845-35eb86fcc2bb\/
    -- [fdea123b-8f68-474a-aa8a-5ff87aa333af,6daf41f0-a138-4eee-89da-123086d36ecf]\"
    -- as the raw value.
    --
    -- Cells with format ATTACHMENT will have the name of the attachment as the
    -- formatted value and the attachment id as the raw value. For example, a
    -- cell containing an attachment named \"image.jpeg\" will have
    -- \"image.jpeg\" as the formatted value and
    -- \"attachment:ca432b2f-b8eb-431d-9fb5-cbe0342f9f03\" as the raw value.
    --
    -- Cells with format AUTO or cells without any format that are
    -- auto-detected as one of the formats above will contain the raw and
    -- formatted values as mentioned above, based on the auto-detected formats.
    -- If there is no auto-detected format, the raw and formatted values will
    -- be the same as the data in the cell.
