    AWS IoT

    AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional communication between
    Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices,
    or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. It implements a broker for
    applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and
    retrieve, update, and delete thing shadows. A thing shadow is a
    persistent representation of your things and their state in the AWS
    cloud.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.IoTDataPlane" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>
    to get started.
