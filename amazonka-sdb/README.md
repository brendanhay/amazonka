## Description

Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions
of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and
effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database,
SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application
development.

A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically
simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and
providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates
the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within
Amazon\'s proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and
pay only for what they use.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sdb)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
