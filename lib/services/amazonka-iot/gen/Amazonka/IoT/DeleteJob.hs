-- Deletes a job and its related job executions.
--
-- Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions
-- created for the job and various other factors. While the job is being
-- deleted, the status of the job will be shown as
-- \"DELETION_IN_PROGRESS\". Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose
-- status is already \"DELETION_IN_PROGRESS\" will result in an error.
--
-- Only 10 jobs may have status \"DELETION_IN_PROGRESS\" at the same time,
-- or a LimitExceededException will occur.
