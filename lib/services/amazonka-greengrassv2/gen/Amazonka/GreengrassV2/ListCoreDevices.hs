-- Retrieves a paginated list of Greengrass core devices.
--
-- IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to
-- the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software
-- isn\'t running on the device, or if device isn\'t connected to the
-- Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might
-- not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the
-- device status was last updated.
--
-- Core devices send status updates at the following times:
--
-- -   When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts
--
-- -   When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web
--     Services Cloud
--
-- -   When the status of any component on the core device becomes @BROKEN@
--
-- -   At a
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-component.html#greengrass-nucleus-component-configuration-fss regular interval that you can configure>,
--     which defaults to 24 hours
--
-- -   For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status updates
--     upon local deployment and cloud deployment
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
