-- Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your
-- on-premises data center. Your Amazon Web Services account must have the
-- right trust policies and permissions in place to create a job for a Snow
-- device. If you\'re creating a job for a node in a cluster, you only need
-- to provide the @clusterId@ value; the other job attributes are inherited
-- from the cluster.
--
-- Only the Snowball; Edge device type is supported when ordering clustered
-- jobs.
--
-- The device capacity is optional.
--
-- Availability of device types differ by Amazon Web Services Region. For
-- more information about Region availability, see
