-- Allocates an Elastic IP address.
--
--
-- An Elastic IP address is for use either in the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. By default, you can allocate 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-Classic per region and 5 Elastic IP addresses for EC2-VPC per region.
--
-- If you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it. To recover an Elastic IP address that you released, specify it in the @Address@ parameter. Note that you cannot recover an Elastic IP address that you released after it is allocated to another AWS account.
--
-- For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html Elastic IP Addresses> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/ .
