-- Removes the specified member accounts from the behavior graph. The
-- removed accounts no longer contribute data to the behavior graph. This
-- operation can only be called by the administrator account for the
-- behavior graph.
--
-- For invited accounts, the removed accounts are deleted from the list of
-- accounts in the behavior graph. To restore the account, the
-- administrator account must send another invitation.
--
-- For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the
-- Detective administrator account can always enable the organization
-- account again. Organization accounts that are not enabled as member
-- accounts are not included in the @ListMembers@ results for the
-- organization behavior graph.
--
-- An administrator account cannot use @DeleteMembers@ to remove their own
-- account from the behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the
-- administrator account uses the @DeleteGraph@ API method.
