-- | Describes an API key.
--
-- Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an
-- identity mechanism. There are two key versions:
--
-- __da1__: This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These
-- keys always expire after 7 days. Key expiration is managed by Amazon
-- DynamoDB TTL. The keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018 and
-- should not be used after that date.
--
-- -   @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
-- -   @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
--
-- -   @UpdateApiKey@ is not available for this key version.
--
-- -   @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
-- -   Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as milliseconds. This
--     results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because
--     DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time
--     action, we will delete these keys from the table after February 21,
--     2018.
--
-- __da2__: This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added
-- support to extend key expiration.
--
-- -   @ListApiKeys@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in
--     seconds.
--
-- -   @CreateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and deletion time in
--     seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.
--
-- -   @UpdateApiKey@ returns the expiration time and and deletion time in
--     seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.
--     Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the expiration time. Key
--     expiration time can be updated while the key is not deleted.
--
-- -   @DeleteApiKey@ deletes the item from the table.
--
-- -   Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. After the
--     expiration time, using the key to authenticate will fail. But the
--     key can be reinstated before deletion.
--
-- -   Deletion is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. The key will be
--     deleted after deletion time.
