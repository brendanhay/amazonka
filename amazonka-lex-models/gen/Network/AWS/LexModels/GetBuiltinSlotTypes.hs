--
-- * 'gbstLocale' - A list of locales that the slot type supports.
--
-- * 'gbstNextToken' - A pagination token that fetches the next page of slot types. If the response to this API call is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a pagination token in the response. To fetch the next page of slot types, specify the pagination token in the next request.
--
-- * 'gbstSignatureContains' - Substring to match in built-in slot type signatures. A slot type will be returned if any part of its signature matches the substring. For example, "xyz" matches both "xyzabc" and "abcxyz."
--
-- * 'gbstMaxResults' - The maximum number of slot types to return in the response. The default is 10.
