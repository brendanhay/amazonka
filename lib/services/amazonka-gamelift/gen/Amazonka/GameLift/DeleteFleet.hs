-- Deletes all resources and information related a fleet. Any current fleet
-- instances, including those in remote locations, are shut down. You
-- don\'t need to call @DeleteFleetLocations@ separately.
--
-- If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need
-- to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization.html CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization>.
-- You do not need to explicitly delete the VPC peering connection.
--
-- To delete a fleet, specify the fleet ID to be terminated. During the
-- deletion process the fleet status is changed to @DELETING@. When
-- completed, the status switches to @TERMINATED@ and the fleet event
-- @FLEET_DELETED@ is sent.
