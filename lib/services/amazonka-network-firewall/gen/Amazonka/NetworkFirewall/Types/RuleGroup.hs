-- | The object that defines the rules in a rule group. This, along with
-- RuleGroupResponse, define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects
-- for a rule group by calling DescribeRuleGroup.
--
-- Network Firewall uses a rule group to inspect and control network
-- traffic. You define stateless rule groups to inspect individual packets
-- and you define stateful rule groups to inspect packets in the context of
-- their traffic flow.
--
-- To use a rule group, you include it by reference in an Network Firewall
-- firewall policy, then you use the policy in a firewall. You can
-- reference a rule group from more than one firewall policy, and you can
-- use a firewall policy in more than one firewall.
