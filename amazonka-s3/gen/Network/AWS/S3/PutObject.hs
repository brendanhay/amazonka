--
-- Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket
-- to add an object to it.
--
-- Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response,
-- Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.
--
-- Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write
-- requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the
-- last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you
-- need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use
-- versioning instead.
--
-- To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
-- @Content-MD5@ header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the
-- object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns
-- an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an
-- object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5
-- value.
--
-- The @Content-MD5@ header is required for any request to upload an object
-- with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more
-- information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Server-side Encryption__
--
-- You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side
-- encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
-- data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the
-- option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption
-- keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption>.
--
-- If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service
-- (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html Amazon S3 Bucket Keys>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers__
--
-- You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all
-- objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding
-- a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to
-- predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added
-- to the ACL on the object. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html Managing ACLs Using the REST API>.
--
-- __Storage Class Options__
--
-- By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly
-- created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and
-- high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a
-- different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS
-- Storage Class. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html Storage Classes>
-- in the /Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Versioning__
--
-- If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates
-- a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this
-- ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon
-- S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously,
-- it stores all of the objects.
--
-- For more information about versioning, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets>.
-- For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html GetBucketVersioning>.
