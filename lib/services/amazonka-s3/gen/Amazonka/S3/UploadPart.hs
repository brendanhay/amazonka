--
-- Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
--
-- In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you
-- have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
-- source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing
-- object, you use the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html UploadPartCopy>
-- operation.
--
-- You must initiate a multipart upload (see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>)
-- before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request,
-- Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must
-- include in your upload part request.
--
-- Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part
-- number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within
-- the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
-- number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part
-- is overwritten.
--
-- For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart
-- upload specifications, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/qfacts.html Multipart upload limits>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network,
-- specify the @Content-MD5@ header in the upload part request. Amazon S3
-- checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
-- match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
--
-- If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon
-- Web Services S3 uses the @x-amz-content-sha256@ header as a checksum
-- instead of @Content-MD5@. For more information see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)>.
--
-- __Note:__ After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more
-- parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to
-- stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
-- either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts
-- storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
--
-- For more information on multipart uploads, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html Multipart Upload Overview>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/ .
--
-- For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
-- API, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html Multipart Upload and Permissions>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3
-- encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
-- decrypts it when you access it. You have three mutually exclusive
-- options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3,
-- depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically,
-- the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon
-- Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
-- Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3
-- managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to
-- encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key
-- options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys
-- (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C). If you choose to
-- provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the
-- request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the
-- upload by using
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>.
-- For more information, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption>
-- in the /Amazon S3 User Guide/.
--
-- Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions.
-- Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you
-- don\'t need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart
-- request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption
-- parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>.
--
-- If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided
-- encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you
-- must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using
-- the following headers.
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
--
-- @UploadPart@ has the following special errors:
--
-- -   -   /Code: NoSuchUpload/
--
--     -   /Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
--         upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
--         been aborted or completed./
--
--     -   /HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found/
--
