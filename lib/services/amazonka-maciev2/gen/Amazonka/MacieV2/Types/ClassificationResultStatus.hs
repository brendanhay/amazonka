    --
    -- -   PARTIAL - Macie analyzed only a subset of the data in the S3 object
    --     that the finding applies to. For example, the object is an archive
    --     file that contains files in an unsupported format.
    --
    -- -   SKIPPED - Macie wasn\'t able to analyze the S3 object that the

    -- Amazon Macie uses this value to notify you of any errors, warnings, or
    -- considerations that might impact your analysis of the finding and the
    -- affected S3 object. Possible values are:
    --
    -- -   ARCHIVE_CONTAINS_UNPROCESSED_FILES - The object is an archive file
    --     and Macie extracted and analyzed only some or none of the files in
    --     the archive. To determine which files Macie analyzed, if any, refer
    --     to the corresponding sensitive data discovery result for the finding
    --     (ClassificationDetails.detailedResultsLocation).
    --
    -- -   ARCHIVE_EXCEEDS_SIZE_LIMIT - The object is an archive file whose
    --     total storage size exceeds the size quota for this type of archive.
    --
    -- -   ARCHIVE_NESTING_LEVEL_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an archive file
    --     whose nested depth exceeds the quota for the maximum number of
    --     nested levels that Macie analyzes for this type of archive.
    --
    -- -   ARCHIVE_TOTAL_BYTES_EXTRACTED_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an archive
    --     file that exceeds the quota for the maximum amount of data that
    --     Macie extracts and analyzes for this type of archive.
    --
    -- -   ARCHIVE_TOTAL_DOCUMENTS_PROCESSED_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an
    --     archive file that contains more than the maximum number of files
    --     that Macie extracts and analyzes for this type of archive.
    --
    -- -   FILE_EXCEEDS_SIZE_LIMIT - The storage size of the object exceeds the
    --     size quota for this type of file.
    --
    -- -   INVALID_ENCRYPTION - The object is encrypted using server-side
    --     encryption but Macie isn\'t allowed to use the key. Macie can\'t
    --     decrypt and analyze the object.
    --
    -- -   INVALID_KMS_KEY - The object is encrypted with an KMS key that was
    --     disabled or is being deleted. Macie can\'t decrypt and analyze the
    --     object.
    --
    -- -   INVALID_OBJECT_STATE - The object doesn\'t use a supported Amazon S3
    --     storage class.
    --
    -- -   JSON_NESTING_LEVEL_OVER_LIMIT - The object contains JSON data and
    --     the nested depth of the data exceeds the quota for the number of
    --     nested levels that Macie analyzes for this type of file.
    --
    -- -   MALFORMED_FILE - The object is a malformed or corrupted file. An
    --     error occurred when Macie attempted to detect the file\'s type or
    --     extract data from the file.
    --
    -- -   MALFORMED_OR_FILE_SIZE_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is a Microsoft
    --     Office file that is malformed or exceeds the size quota for this
    --     type of file. If the file is malformed, an error occurred when Macie
    --     attempted to extract data from the file.
    --
    -- -   NO_SUCH_BUCKET_AVAILABLE - The object was in a bucket that was
    --     deleted shortly before or when Macie attempted to analyze the
    --     object.
    --
    -- -   OBJECT_VERSION_MISMATCH - The object was changed while Macie was
    --     analyzing it.
    --
    -- -   OOXML_UNCOMPRESSED_RATIO_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is an Office
    --     Open XML file whose compression ratio exceeds the compression quota
    --     for this type of file.
    --
    -- -   OOXML_UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is an Office Open
    --     XML file that exceeds the size quota for this type of file.
    --
    -- -   PERMISSION_DENIED - Macie isn\'t allowed to access the object. The
    --     object\'s permissions settings prevent Macie from analyzing the
    --     object.
    --
    -- -   SOURCE_OBJECT_NO_LONGER_AVAILABLE - The object was deleted shortly
    --     before or when Macie attempted to analyze it.
    --
    -- -   TIME_CUT_OFF_REACHED - Macie started analyzing the object but
    --     additional analysis would exceed the time quota for analyzing an
    --     object.
    --
    -- -   UNABLE_TO_PARSE_FILE - The object is a file that contains structured
    --     data and an error occurred when Macie attempted to parse the data.
    --
    -- -   UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE_EXCEPTION - The object is a file that uses an
    --     unsupported file or storage format.
