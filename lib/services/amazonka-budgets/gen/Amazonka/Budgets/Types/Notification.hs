-- | A notification that\'s associated with a budget. A budget can have up to
-- ten notifications.
--
-- Each notification must have at least one subscriber. A notification can
-- have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers, for a total of
-- 11 subscribers.
--
-- For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you want to be
-- notified when you go over 160 dollars, create a notification with the
-- following parameters:
--
-- -   A notificationType of @ACTUAL@
--
-- -   A @thresholdType@ of @PERCENTAGE@
--
-- -   A @comparisonOperator@ of @GREATER_THAN@
--
-- -   A notification @threshold@ of @80@
