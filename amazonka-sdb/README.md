## Description

Amazon SimpleDB is a highly available and flexible non-relational data store
that offloads the work of database administration. Developers simply store
and query data items via web services requests and Amazon SimpleDB does the
rest. Unbound by the strict requirements of a relational database, Amazon
SimpleDB is optimized to provide high availability and flexibility, with
little or no administrative burden. Behind the scenes, Amazon SimpleDB
creates and manages multiple geographically distributed replicas of your data
automatically to enable high availability and data durability. The service
charges you only for the resources actually consumed in storing your data and
serving your requests. You can change your data model on the fly, and data is
automatically indexed for you. With Amazon SimpleDB, you can focus on
application development without worrying about infrastructure provisioning,
high availability, software maintenance, schema and index management, or
performance tuning.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sdb)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API.html).
