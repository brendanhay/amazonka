--
-- Addons for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-s3 amazonka-s3> to
-- support client-side encryption.
--
-- Your client-side master keys and your unencrypted data are never sent to AWS;
-- therefore, it is important that you safely manage your encryption keys. If
-- you lose them, you won't be able to decrypt your data.
-- When generating a symmetric key, you should ensure
-- that the key length is compatible with the underlying 'AES256' cipher.
--
-- The encryption procedure is:
--
-- * A one-time-use symmetric key a.k.a. a data encryption key (or data key) and
-- initialisation vector (IV) are generated locally. This data key and IV are used
-- to encrypt the data of a single S3 object using an AES256 cipher in CBC mode,
-- with PKCS5 padding. (For each object sent, a completely separate data key and IV are generated.)
--
-- * The generated data encryption key used above is encrypted using a symmetric
-- AES256 cipher in ECB mode, asymmetric RSA, or KMS facilities, depending on the
-- client-side master key you provide.
--
-- * The encrypted data is uploaded and the encrypted data key and material description
-- are attached as object metadata (either headers or a separate instruction file).
-- If KMS is used, the material description helps determine which client-side master
-- key to later use for decryption, otherwise the configured client-side key at
-- time of decryption is used.
--
-- For decryption:
--
-- The encrypted object is downloaded from Amazon S3 along with any metadata.
-- If KMS was used to encrypt the data then the master key id is taken from the
-- metadata material description, otherwise the client-side master key in the
-- current environment is used to decrypt the data key, which in turn is used
-- to decrypt the object data.
--
-- The client-side master key you provide can be either a symmetric key, an
-- asymmetric public/private key pair, or a KMS master key.
--
-- The stored metadata format is designed to be compatible with the official Java
-- AWS SDK (both V1 and V2 envelopes), but only a limited set of the possible
-- encryption options are supported. Therefore assuming defaults, objects stored
-- with this library should be retrievable by any of the other official SDKs, and
-- vice versa.

-- $usage
-- When sending requests that make use of a master key, an extension to the underlying
-- 'AWS' environment is required. You can specify this environment as follows:
--
-- @
-- import Network.AWS
-- import Network.AWS.S3
-- import Network.AWS.S3.Encryption
-- import System.IO
--
-- example :: Key -> IO GetObjectResponse
-- example k = do
--     -- A standard AWS environment with credentials is created using 'newEnv':
--     e <- newEnv Frankfurt Discover
--
--     -- The environment needed for encryption is then extended using a 'Key':
--     runAWS (KeyEnv e (kmsKey "alias/master-key")) $ do
--         -- To store an encrypted object, 'encrypt' is used inplace of where you would
--         -- typically use 'AWS.send':
--         _  <- encrypt (putObject "bucket-name" "object-key" body)
--
--         -- To retrieve a previously encrypted object, 'decrypt' is used, again similarly to
--         -- how you'd use 'AWS.send':
--         rs <- decrypt (getObject "bucket-name" "object-key")
--
--         -- The 'GetObjectResponse' here contains a 'gorsBody' that is decrypted during read:
--         return rs
-- @

-- $master-key
-- You master key should be stored and secured by you alone (or KMS). The specific
-- key that is used to encrypt an object is required to decrypt the same object.
-- If you lose this key, you will not be able to decrypt the related objects.

-- $errors
-- Errors are thrown by the library using 'MonadThrow' and will consist of one of
-- the branches from 'EncryptionError' for anything crypto related, or a disparate
-- 'AWS.Error' anything related to the underlying 'AWS' service calls.
--
-- You can catch errors and sub-errors via 'trying' etc. from "Control.Exception.Lens",
-- and the appropriate 'AsEncryptionError' 'Prism':
--
-- @
-- trying '_EncryptionError' (encrypt (putObject "bkt" "key")) :: Either 'EncryptionError' PutObjectResponse
-- @

-- $requests
-- Only a small number of S3 operations actually utilise encryption/decryption
-- behaviour, namely 'PutObject', 'GetObject', and the related multipart upload
-- operations. The following functions store the encryption envelope in object
-- metadata (headers).

-- $instructions
-- An alternative method of storing the encryption envelope in an adjacent S3
-- object is provided for the case when metadata headers are reserved for other
-- data. This method removes the metadata overhead at the expense of an additional
-- HTTP request to perform encryption/decryption.
-- The provided @*Instruction@ functions make the convenient assumption that
-- the 'defaultExtension' is desired. If you wish to override the suffix\/extension,
-- you can simply call the underlying plumbing to modify the
-- 'PutInstructions' or 'GetInstructions' suffix before sending.
--
-- An example of encryption with a non-default instruction extension:
--
-- @
-- (a, b) <- 'encrypted' (x :: 'PutObject')
-- _      <- 'AWS.send' (b & 'piExtension' .~ ".envelope") -- Store the custom instruction file.
-- 'AWS.send' a -- Store the actual encrypted object.
-- @
