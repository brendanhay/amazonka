-- Deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can perform a conditional delete operation that deletes the item if it exists, or if it has an expected attribute value.
--
--
-- In addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the @ReturnValues@ parameter.
--
-- Unless you specify conditions, the @DeleteItem@ is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does /not/ result in an error response.
--
-- Conditional deletes are useful for deleting items only if specific conditions are met. If those conditions are met, DynamoDB performs the delete. Otherwise, the item is not deleted.

-- | Creates a value of 'DeleteItem' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'diExpressionAttributeNames' - One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using @ExpressionAttributeNames@ :     * To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.     * To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.     * To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression. Use the __#__ character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:     * @Percentile@  The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ReservedWords.html Reserved Words> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ ). To work around this, you could specify the following for @ExpressionAttributeNames@ :     * @{"#P":"Percentile"}@  You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:     * @#P = :val@  For more information on expression attribute names, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.AccessingItemAttributes.html Accessing Item Attributes> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'diReturnValues' - Use @ReturnValues@ if you want to get the item attributes as they appeared before they were deleted. For @DeleteItem@ , the valid values are:     * @NONE@ - If @ReturnValues@ is not specified, or if its value is @NONE@ , then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for @ReturnValues@ .)     * @ALL_OLD@ - The content of the old item is returned.
--
-- * 'diExpressionAttributeValues' - One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the __:__ (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the /ProductStatus/ attribute was one of the following:  @Available | Backordered | Discontinued@  You would first need to specify @ExpressionAttributeValues@ as follows: @{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }@  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: @ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)@  For more information on expression attribute values, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.SpecifyingConditions.html Specifying Conditions> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'diReturnConsumedCapacity' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'diReturnItemCollectionMetrics' - Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to @SIZE@ , the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to @NONE@ (the default), no statistics are returned.
--
-- * 'diConditionExpression' - A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional @DeleteItem@ to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following:     * Functions: @attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size@  These function names are case-sensitive.     * Comparison operators: @= | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN @      * Logical operators: @AND | OR | NOT@  For more information on condition expressions, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.SpecifyingConditions.html Specifying Conditions> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'diConditionalOperator' - This is a legacy parameter. Use @ConditionExpression@ instead. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.ConditionalOperator.html ConditionalOperator> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'diExpected' - This is a legacy parameter. Use @ConditionExpression@ instead. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.Expected.html Expected> in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/ .
--
-- * 'diTableName' - The name of the table from which to delete the item.
--
-- * 'diKey' - A map of attribute names to @AttributeValue@ objects, representing the primary key of the item to delete. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the sort key.
