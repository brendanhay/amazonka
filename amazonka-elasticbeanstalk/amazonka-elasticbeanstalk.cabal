    AWS Elastic Beanstalk

    This is the AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference. This guide provides
    detailed information about AWS Elastic Beanstalk actions, data types,
    parameters, and errors.

    AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a tool that makes it easy for you to create,
    deploy, and manage scalable, fault-tolerant applications running on
    Amazon Web Services cloud resources.

    For more information about this product, go to the
    <http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/ AWS Elastic Beanstalk> details
    page. The location of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk WSDL is
    <http://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl>.
    To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to
    access the API, go to
    <https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.

    __Endpoints__

    For a list of region-specific endpoints that AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    supports, go to
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region Regions and Endpoints>
    in the /Amazon Web Services Glossary/.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.ElasticBeanstalk" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
