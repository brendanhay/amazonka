-- Lists all policies from the root of the 'Directory' to the object specified. If there are no policies present, an empty list is returned. If policies are present, and if some objects don't have the policies attached, it returns the @ObjectIdentifier@ for such objects. If policies are present, it returns @ObjectIdentifier@ , @policyId@ , and @policyType@ . Paths that don't lead to the root from the target object are ignored. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/cd_key_concepts.html#policies Policies> .
