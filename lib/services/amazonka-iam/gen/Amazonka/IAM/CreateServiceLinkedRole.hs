-- Creates an IAM role that is linked to a specific Amazon Web Services
-- service. The service controls the attached policies and when the role
-- can be deleted. This helps ensure that the service is not broken by an
-- unexpectedly changed or deleted role, which could put your Amazon Web
-- Services resources into an unknown state. Allowing the service to
-- control the role helps improve service stability and proper cleanup when
-- a service and its role are no longer needed. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html Using service-linked roles>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- To attach a policy to this service-linked role, you must make the
-- request using the Amazon Web Services service that depends on this role.
