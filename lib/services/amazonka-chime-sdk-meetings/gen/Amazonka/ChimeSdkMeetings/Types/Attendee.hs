-- | An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique @AttendeeId@ and
-- @JoinToken@. The @JoinToken@ allows a client to authenticate and join as
-- the specified attendee. The @JoinToken@ expires when the meeting ends,
-- or when DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the attendee is unable to
-- join the meeting.
--
-- We recommend securely transferring each @JoinToken@ from your server
-- application to the client so that no other client has access to the
-- token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.
