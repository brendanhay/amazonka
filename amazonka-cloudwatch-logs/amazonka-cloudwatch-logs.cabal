    Amazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference

    You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
    log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances,
    Amazon CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then retrieve the
    associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the Amazon CloudWatch
    console, the CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, the CloudWatch
    Logs API, or the CloudWatch Logs SDK.

    You can use CloudWatch Logs to:

    -   __Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time__: You can use
        CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data.
        For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that
        occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever
        the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs
        uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required.
        For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal
        terms (such as \"NullReferenceException\") or count the number of
        occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data
        (such as \"404\" status codes in an Apache access log). When the
        term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the
        data to a Amazon CloudWatch metric that you specify.

    -   __Monitor Amazon CloudTrail Logged Events__: You can create alarms
        in Amazon CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API
        activity as captured by CloudTrail and use the notification to
        perform troubleshooting.

    -   __Archive Log Data__: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log
        data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention
        setting so that any log events older than this setting are
        automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to
        quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and
        into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you
        need it.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
