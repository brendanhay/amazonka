-- | The Service Connect configuration of your Amazon ECS service. The
-- configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and
-- be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a namespace.
--
-- Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
-- in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
-- clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
-- container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
-- the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
-- Connect. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html Service Connect>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
