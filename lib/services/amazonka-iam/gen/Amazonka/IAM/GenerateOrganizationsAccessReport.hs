-- Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You
-- can generate a report for any entities (organization root,
-- organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization.
--
-- To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations
-- management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or
-- root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM
-- role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the
-- required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html Refining permissions using service last accessed data>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by
-- specifying only the entity\'s path. This data includes a list of
-- services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that
-- apply to the entity.
--
-- You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by
-- specifying an entity\'s path and an optional Organizations policy ID.
-- This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified
-- SCP.
--
-- For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent
-- account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the
-- entity or the entity\'s children. For important information about the
-- data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and
-- supported Regions see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html Reducing permissions using service last accessed data>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just
-- the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the
-- Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API
-- through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected
-- entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account
-- has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer
-- to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information
-- about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.
-- For more information,
-- see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/cloudtrail-integration.html Logging IAM events with CloudTrail>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- This operation returns a @JobId@. Use this parameter in the
-- @ @@GetOrganizationsAccessReport@@ @ operation to check the status of
-- the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the
-- @JobId@ parameter in the @ @@GetOrganizationsAccessReport@@ @ operation
-- and test the @JobStatus@ response parameter. When the job is complete,
-- you can retrieve the report.
--
-- To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an
-- entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The
-- type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the
-- report.
--
-- -   __Root__ – When you specify the organizations root as the entity,
--     the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that
--     are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes
--     data for all accounts in your organization except the management
--     account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.
--
-- -   __OU__ – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity,
--     the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that
--     are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report
--     includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data
--     excludes the management account, because the management account is
--     not limited by SCPs.
--
-- -   __management account__ – When you specify the management account,
--     the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because
--     the management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the
--     report includes data for only the management account.
--
-- -   __Account__ – When you specify another account as the entity, the
--     resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are
--     attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the
--     report includes data for only the specified account.
--
-- To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an
-- entity path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity
-- that you specify determines the data returned for each service.
--
-- -   __Root__ – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the
--     resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the
--     specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all
--     accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data
--     excludes the management account, because the management account is
--     not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in
--     the organization, then the report will return a list of services
--     with no data.
--
-- -   __OU__ – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the
--     resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the
--     specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all
--     accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This
--     means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the
--     SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the
--     management account, because the management account is not limited by
--     SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children,
--     the report will return a list of services with no data.
--
-- -   __management account__ – When you specify the management account,
--     the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because
--     the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a
--     policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each
--     service, the report includes data for only the management account.
--
-- -   __Account__ – When you specify another account entity and a policy
--     ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed
--     by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for
--     only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the
--     organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in
--     the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will
--     return a list of services with no data.
--
-- Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when
-- determining whether a principal could access a service. These other
-- policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies,
-- access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role
-- policies. It only applies SCP logic. For more about the evaluation of
-- policy types, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics Evaluating policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
