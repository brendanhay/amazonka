-- Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing dashboard. If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what you specify here.
--
--
-- You can have up to 500 dashboards per account. All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific.
--
-- A simple way to create a dashboard using @PutDashboard@ is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use @GetDashboard@ , and then use the data returned within @DashboardBody@ as the template for the new dashboard when you call @PutDashboard@ .
--
-- When you create a dashboard with @PutDashboard@ , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the @DashboardBody@ script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.
