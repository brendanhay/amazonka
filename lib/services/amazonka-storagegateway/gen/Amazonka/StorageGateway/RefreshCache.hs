--
-- Refreshes the cached inventory of objects for the specified file share.
-- This operation finds objects in the Amazon S3 bucket that were added,
-- removed, or replaced since the gateway last listed the bucket\'s
-- contents and cached the results. This operation does not import files
-- into the S3 File Gateway cache storage. It only updates the cached
-- inventory to reflect changes in the inventory of the objects in the S3
-- bucket. This operation is only supported in the S3 File Gateway types.
--
-- You can subscribe to be notified through an Amazon CloudWatch event when
-- your @RefreshCache@ operation completes. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification Getting notified about file operations>
-- in the /Storage Gateway User Guide/. This operation is Only supported
-- for S3 File Gateways.
--
-- When this API is called, it only initiates the refresh operation. When
-- the API call completes and returns a success code, it doesn\'t
-- necessarily mean that the file refresh has completed. You should use the
-- refresh-complete notification to determine that the operation has
-- completed before you check for new files on the gateway file share. You
-- can subscribe to be notified through a CloudWatch event when your
-- @RefreshCache@ operation completes.
--
-- Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no
-- more than two refreshes at any time. We recommend using the
-- refresh-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing additional
-- requests. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification Getting notified about file operations>
-- in the /Storage Gateway User Guide/.
--
-- -   Wait at least 60 seconds between consecutive RefreshCache API
--     requests.
--
-- -   RefreshCache does not evict cache entries if invoked consecutively
--     within 60 seconds of a previous RefreshCache request.
--
-- -   If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already
--     being processed, any new request will cause an
--     @InvalidGatewayRequestException@ error because too many requests
--     were sent to the server.
--
-- The S3 bucket name does not need to be included when entering the list
-- of folders in the FolderList parameter.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification Getting notified about file operations>
-- in the /Storage Gateway User Guide/.
