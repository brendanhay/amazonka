-- Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the
-- requesting user is part of. The @ListHandshakesForOrganization@
-- operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure
-- contains details and status about a handshake.
--
-- Handshakes that are @ACCEPTED@, @DECLINED@, or @CANCELED@ appear in the
-- results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state. After
-- that, they\'re deleted and no longer accessible.
--
-- Always check the @NextToken@ response parameter for a @null@ value when
-- calling a @List*@ operation. These operations can occasionally return an
-- empty set of results even when there are more results available. The
-- @NextToken@ response parameter value is @null@ /only/ when there are no
-- more results to display.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account or by a member account that is a delegated administrator for an
-- AWS service.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
