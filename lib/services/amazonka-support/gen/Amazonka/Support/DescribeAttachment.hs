-- Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can
-- include screenshots, error logs, or other files that describe your
-- issue. Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when
-- you add an attachment to a case or case communication. Attachment IDs
-- are returned in the AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the
-- DescribeCommunications operation.
