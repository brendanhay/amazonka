--
-- Uploads a part in a multipart upload.
--
-- In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you
-- have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data
-- source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing
-- object, you use the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html UploadPartCopy>
-- operation.
--
-- You must initiate a multipart upload (see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>)
-- before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request,
-- Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must
-- include in your upload part request.
--
-- Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part
-- number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within
-- the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part
-- number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part
-- is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last
-- part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.
--
-- To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network,
-- specify the @Content-MD5@ header in the upload part request. Amazon S3
-- checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not
-- match, Amazon S3 returns an error.
--
-- If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3
-- uses the @x-amz-content-sha256@ header as a checksum instead of
-- @Content-MD5@. For more information see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4)>.
--
-- __Note:__ After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more
-- parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to
-- stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you
-- either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts
-- storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.
--
-- For more information on multipart uploads, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html Multipart Upload Overview>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/ .
--
-- For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload
-- API, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html Multipart Upload API and Permissions>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3
-- encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
-- decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing
-- your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys.
-- If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers
-- you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the
-- request to initiate the upload by using
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>.
-- For more information, go to
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions.
-- Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don\'t need
-- to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request.
-- Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters
-- in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html CreateMultipartUpload>.
--
-- If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided
-- encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must
-- provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the
-- following headers.
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key
--
-- -   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5
--
-- __Special Errors__
--
-- -   -   /Code: NoSuchUpload/
--
--     -   /Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The
--         upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have
--         been aborted or completed./
--
--     -   /HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found/
--
--     -   /SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client/
