-- Creates an Evidently /experiment/. Before you create an experiment, you
-- must create the feature to use for the experiment.
--
-- An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence
-- and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once.
-- Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by statistical
-- methods, and provides clear recommendations about which variations
-- perform better.
--
-- You can optionally specify a @segment@ to have the experiment consider
-- only certain audience types in the experiment, such as using only user
-- sessions from a certain location or who use a certain internet browser.
--
-- Don\'t use this operation to update an existing experiment. Instead, use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateExperiment.html UpdateExperiment>.
