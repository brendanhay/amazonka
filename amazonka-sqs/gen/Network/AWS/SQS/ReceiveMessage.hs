-- Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue.
-- Using the @WaitTimeSeconds@ parameter enables long-poll support. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html Amazon SQS Long Polling>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of
-- machines is sampled on a @ReceiveMessage@ call. Thus, only the messages
-- on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the
-- queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages
-- than you requested per @ReceiveMessage@ call. If the number of messages
-- in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a
-- particular @ReceiveMessage@ response. If this happens, repeat the
-- request.
--
-- For each message returned, the response includes the following:
--
-- -   The message body.
--
-- -   An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see
--     <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt RFC1321>.
--
-- -   The @MessageId@ you received when you sent the message to the queue.
--
-- -   The receipt handle.
--
-- -   The message attributes.
--
-- -   An MD5 digest of the message attributes.
--
-- The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the
-- message. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html Queue and Message Identifiers>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- You can provide the @VisibilityTimeout@ parameter in your request. The
-- parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the
-- response. If you don\'t include the parameter, the overall visibility
-- timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Visibility Timeout>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- A message that isn\'t deleted or a message whose visibility isn\'t
-- extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed
-- receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might
-- be sent to the dead-letter queue.
--
-- In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that
-- calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it
-- can handle new attributes gracefully.

    messageAttributeNames :: Prelude.Maybe [Prelude.Text],
    -- | A list of attributes that need to be returned along with each message.
    -- These attributes include:
    --
    -- -   @All@ – Returns all values.

    --     was first received from the queue
    --     (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time epoch time> in
    --     milliseconds).
    --
    -- -   @ApproximateReceiveCount@ – Returns the number of times a message

    --
    -- -   @AWSTraceHeader@ – Returns the AWS X-Ray trace header string.
    --
    -- -   @SenderId@
    --
    --     -   For an IAM user, returns the IAM user ID, for example
    --         @ABCDEFGHI1JKLMNOPQ23R@.
    --
    --     -   For an IAM role, returns the IAM role ID, for example

    --
    -- -   @SentTimestamp@ – Returns the time the message was sent to the queue

    -- -   @MessageDeduplicationId@ – Returns the value provided by the
    --     producer that calls the @ SendMessage @ action.
    --
    -- -   @MessageGroupId@ – Returns the value provided by the producer that
    --     calls the @ SendMessage @ action. Messages with the same
    --     @MessageGroupId@ are returned in sequence.
    --
    -- -   @SequenceNumber@ – Returns the value provided by Amazon SQS.
    attributeNames :: Prelude.Maybe [MessageAttribute],
    -- | The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to
    -- arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the
    -- call returns sooner than @WaitTimeSeconds@. If no messages are available
    -- and the wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty
    -- list of messages.
    --
    -- To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for
    -- @ReceiveMessage@ requests is longer than the @WaitTimeSeconds@
    -- parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport
    -- settings using the
    -- <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/nio/netty/NettyNioAsyncHttpClient.html NettyNioAsyncHttpClient>
    -- for asynchronous clients, or the
    -- <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/http/apache/ApacheHttpClient.html ApacheHttpClient>
    -- for synchronous clients.
    waitTimeSeconds :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Int,
    -- | This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.
    --
    -- The token used for deduplication of @ReceiveMessage@ calls. If a
    -- networking issue occurs after a @ReceiveMessage@ action, and instead of
    -- a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same
    -- action with an identical @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ to retrieve the same
    -- set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.
    --
    -- -   You can use @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ only for 5 minutes after a
    --     @ReceiveMessage@ action.
    --
    -- -   When you set @FifoQueue@, a caller of the @ReceiveMessage@ action
    --     can provide a @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ explicitly.
    --
    -- -   If a caller of the @ReceiveMessage@ action doesn\'t provide a
    --     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@, Amazon SQS generates a
    --     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@.
    --
    -- -   It is possible to retry the @ReceiveMessage@ action with the same
    --     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ if none of the messages have been modified
    --     (deleted or had their visibility changes).
    --
    -- -   During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same
    --     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ return the same messages and receipt
    --     handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it
    --     resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html Visibility Timeout>
    --     in the /Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide/.
    --
    --     If a caller of the @ReceiveMessage@ action still processes messages
    --     when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible,
    --     another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same
    --     messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose
    --     message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries
    --     to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error.
    --
    --     To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a
    --     safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the
    --     visibility timeout as necessary.
    --
    -- -   While messages with a particular @MessageGroupId@ are invisible, no
    --     more messages belonging to the same @MessageGroupId@ are returned
    --     until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages
    --     with another @MessageGroupId@ as long as it is also visible.
    --
    -- -   If a caller of @ReceiveMessage@ can\'t track the
    --     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@, no retries work until the original
    --     visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the
    --     messages in the queue remain in a strict order.
    --
    -- The maximum length of @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ is 128 characters.
    -- @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ can contain alphanumeric characters (@a-z@,
    -- @A-Z@, @0-9@) and punctuation
    -- (@!\"#$%&\'()*+,-.\/:;\<=>?\@[\\]^_\`{|}~@).
    --

--     another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same
--     messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose
--     message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries
--     to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error.
--
--     To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a
--     safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the
--     visibility timeout as necessary.
--
-- -   While messages with a particular @MessageGroupId@ are invisible, no
--     more messages belonging to the same @MessageGroupId@ are returned
--     until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages
--     with another @MessageGroupId@ as long as it is also visible.
--
-- -   If a caller of @ReceiveMessage@ can\'t track the
--     @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@, no retries work until the original
--     visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the
--     messages in the queue remain in a strict order.
--
-- The maximum length of @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ is 128 characters.
-- @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@ can contain alphanumeric characters (@a-z@,
-- @A-Z@, @0-9@) and punctuation
-- (@!\"#$%&\'()*+,-.\/:;\<=>?\@[\\]^_\`{|}~@).
--
-- For best practices of using @ReceiveRequestAttemptId@, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-receiverequestattemptid-request-parameter.html Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter>
