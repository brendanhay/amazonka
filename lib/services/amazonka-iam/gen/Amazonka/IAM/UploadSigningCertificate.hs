-- Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
-- specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use
-- certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding
-- private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is
-- @Active@.
--
-- For information about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html Managing server certificates in IAM>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- If the @UserName@ is not specified, the IAM user name is determined
-- implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID used to sign
-- the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web
-- Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage
-- Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the Amazon Web
-- Services account has no associated users.
--
-- Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use
-- POST rather than GET when calling @UploadSigningCertificate@. For
-- information about setting up signatures and authorization through the
-- API, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html Signing Amazon Web Services API requests>
-- in the /Amazon Web Services General Reference/. For general information
-- about using the Query API with IAM, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html Making query requests>
