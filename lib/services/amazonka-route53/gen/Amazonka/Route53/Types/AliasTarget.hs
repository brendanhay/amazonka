    --
    --     The name of the record that you\'re creating must match a custom

    --     corresponding CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of
    --     @DnsName@ using the CLI command
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html describe-vpc-endpoints>.
    --
    -- [CloudFront distribution]
    --     Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created
    --     your distribution.
    --
    --     Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name
    --     that matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if
    --     the name of the resource record set is /acme.example.com/, your
    --     CloudFront distribution must include /acme.example.com/ as one of
    --     the alternate domain names. For more information, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)>
    --     in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/.
    --
    --     You can\'t create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to
    --     route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.
    --
    --     For failover alias records, you can\'t specify a CloudFront
    --     distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A
    --     distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
    --     name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
    --     the same name, and you can\'t include the same alternate domain name
    --     in more than one distribution.
    --
    -- [Elastic Beanstalk environment]
    --     If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes
    --     the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an
    --     alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example,
    --     the domain name
    --     @my-environment.@/@us-west-2@/@.elasticbeanstalk.com@ is a
    --     regionalized domain name.
    --
    --     For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain
    --     name doesn\'t include the region. To route traffic to these
    --     environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias
    --     record. Note that you can\'t create a CNAME record for the root
    --     domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
    --     can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your
    --     Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can\'t create a record that
    --     routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
    --     environment.
    --
    --     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized
    --     subdomains, specify the @CNAME@ attribute for the environment. You
    --     can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
    --     attribute:
    --
    --     -   /Amazon Web Services Management Console/: For information about
    --         how to get the value by using the console, see
    --         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html Using Custom Domains with Elastic Beanstalk>
    --         in the /Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide/.
    --
    --     -   /Elastic Beanstalk API/: Use the @DescribeEnvironments@ action
    --         to get the value of the @CNAME@ attribute. For more information,
    --         see
    --         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html DescribeEnvironments>
    --         in the /Elastic Beanstalk API Reference/.
    --
    --     -   /CLI/: Use the @describe-environments@ command to get the value
    --         of the @CNAME@ attribute. For more information, see
    --         <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html describe-environments>
    --         in the /CLI Command Reference/.
    --
    -- [ELB load balancer]
    --     Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get
    --     the DNS name by using the Amazon Web Services Management Console,
    --     the ELB API, or the CLI.
    --
    --     -   __Amazon Web Services Management Console__: Go to the EC2 page,
    --         choose __Load Balancers__ in the navigation pane, choose the
    --         load balancer, choose the __Description__ tab, and get the value
    --         of the __DNS name__ field.
    --
    --         If you\'re routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the
    --         value that begins with __dualstack__. If you\'re routing traffic
    --         to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to
    --         the record type, A or AAAA.
    --
    --     -   __Elastic Load Balancing API__: Use @DescribeLoadBalancers@ to
    --         get the value of @DNSName@. For more information, see the

    --
    -- [Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website]
    --     Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you
    --     created the bucket in, for example,
    --     @s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com@. For more information about
    --     valid values, see the table
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints Amazon S3 Website Endpoints>
    --     in the /Amazon Web Services General Reference/. For more information
    --     about using S3 buckets for websites, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html Getting Started with Amazon Route 53>
    --     in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide./
    --
    -- [Another Route 53 resource record set]
    --     Specify the value of the @Name@ element for a resource record set in
    --     the current hosted zone.
    --
    --     If you\'re creating an alias record that has the same name as the
    --     hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can\'t specify the domain
    --     name for a record for which the value of @Type@ is @CNAME@. This is
    --     because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
    --     you\'re routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone
    --     apex isn\'t supported even for an alias record.
    dNSName :: Prelude.Text,
    -- | /Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
    -- alias, and weighted alias resource record sets:/ When
    -- @EvaluateTargetHealth@ is @true@, an alias resource record set inherits
    -- the health of the referenced Amazon Web Services resource, such as an
    -- ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.
    --
    -- Note the following:
    --
    -- [CloudFront distributions]
    --     You can\'t set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ when the alias
    --     target is a CloudFront distribution.
    --
    -- [Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains]
    --     If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in @DNSName@ and the
    --     environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing
    --     routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
    --     registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically
    --     contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon
    --     EC2 instance.) If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ and
    --     either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer
    --     itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available
    --     resources that are healthy, if any.
    --
    --     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are
    --     no special requirements.
    --
    -- [ELB load balancers]
    --     Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
    --
    --     -   __Classic Load Balancers__: If you specify an ELB Classic Load
    --         Balancer in @DNSName@, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries
    --         only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
    --         with the load balancer. If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to
    --         @true@ and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
    --         balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
    --         resources.
    --
    --     -   __Application and Network Load Balancers__: If you specify an
    --         ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
    --         @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@, Route 53 routes queries to the
    --         load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
    --         associated with the load balancer:
    --
    --         -   For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered
    --             healthy, every target group that contains targets must
    --             contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
    --             contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is
    --             considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other
    --             resources.
    --
    --         -   A target group that has no registered targets is considered
    --             unhealthy.
    --
    --     When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic
    --     Load Balancing health checks; they\'re not Route 53 health checks,
    --     but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health
    --     checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
    --     balancer.
    --
    -- [S3 buckets]
    --     There are no special requirements for setting @EvaluateTargetHealth@
    --     to @true@ when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
    --
    -- [Other records in the same hosted zone]
    --     If the Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in @DNSName@ is
    --     a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted
    --     records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
    --     associate a health check with all of the records in the alias
    --     target. For more information, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?>

--
--     The name of the record that you\'re creating must match a custom

--
-- [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint]
--     Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
--     @vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com@.
--     For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the

--     @DnsName@ using the CLI command
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html describe-vpc-endpoints>.
--
-- [CloudFront distribution]
--     Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created
--     your distribution.
--
--     Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name
--     that matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if
--     the name of the resource record set is /acme.example.com/, your
--     CloudFront distribution must include /acme.example.com/ as one of
--     the alternate domain names. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)>
--     in the /Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide/.
--
--     You can\'t create a resource record set in a private hosted zone to
--     route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.
--
--     For failover alias records, you can\'t specify a CloudFront
--     distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A
--     distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the
--     name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have
--     the same name, and you can\'t include the same alternate domain name
--     in more than one distribution.
--
-- [Elastic Beanstalk environment]
--     If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes
--     the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an
--     alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example,
--     the domain name
--     @my-environment.@/@us-west-2@/@.elasticbeanstalk.com@ is a
--     regionalized domain name.
--
--     For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain
--     name doesn\'t include the region. To route traffic to these
--     environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias
--     record. Note that you can\'t create a CNAME record for the root
--     domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
--     can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your
--     Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can\'t create a record that
--     routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
--     environment.
--
--     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized
--     subdomains, specify the @CNAME@ attribute for the environment. You
--     can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME
--     attribute:
--
--     -   /Amazon Web Services Management Console/: For information about
--         how to get the value by using the console, see

-- [ELB load balancer]
--     Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get
--     the DNS name by using the Amazon Web Services Management Console,
--     the ELB API, or the CLI.
--
--     -   __Amazon Web Services Management Console__: Go to the EC2 page,

--
--         If you\'re routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the
--         value that begins with __dualstack__. If you\'re routing traffic
--         to another type of load balancer, get the value that applies to

--
-- [Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website]
--     Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you
--     created the bucket in, for example,
--     @s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com@. For more information about
--     valid values, see the table

--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started.html Getting Started with Amazon Route 53>
--     in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide./
--
-- [Another Route 53 resource record set]
--     Specify the value of the @Name@ element for a resource record set in
--     the current hosted zone.
--
--     If you\'re creating an alias record that has the same name as the
--     hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can\'t specify the domain
--     name for a record for which the value of @Type@ is @CNAME@. This is
--     because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
--     you\'re routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone
--     apex isn\'t supported even for an alias record.
--
-- 'evaluateTargetHealth', 'aliasTarget_evaluateTargetHealth' - /Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
-- alias, and weighted alias resource record sets:/ When
-- @EvaluateTargetHealth@ is @true@, an alias resource record set inherits
-- the health of the referenced Amazon Web Services resource, such as an
-- ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.
--
-- Note the following:
--
-- [CloudFront distributions]
--     You can\'t set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ when the alias
--     target is a CloudFront distribution.
--
-- [Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains]
--     If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in @DNSName@ and the
--     environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing
--     routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
--     registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically
--     contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon
--     EC2 instance.) If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ and
--     either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer
--     itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available
--     resources that are healthy, if any.
--
--     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are
--     no special requirements.
--
-- [ELB load balancers]
--     Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
--
--     -   __Classic Load Balancers__: If you specify an ELB Classic Load
--         Balancer in @DNSName@, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries
--         only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
--         with the load balancer. If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to
--         @true@ and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
--         balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
--         resources.
--
--     -   __Application and Network Load Balancers__: If you specify an
--         ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
--         @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@, Route 53 routes queries to the
--         load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
--         associated with the load balancer:
--
--         -   For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered
--             healthy, every target group that contains targets must
--             contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
--             contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is
--             considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other
--             resources.
--
--         -   A target group that has no registered targets is considered
--             unhealthy.
--
--     When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic
--     Load Balancing health checks; they\'re not Route 53 health checks,
--     but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health
--     checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
--     balancer.
--
-- [S3 buckets]
--     There are no special requirements for setting @EvaluateTargetHealth@
--     to @true@ when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
--
-- [Other records in the same hosted zone]
--     If the Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in @DNSName@ is
--     a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted
--     records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
--     associate a health check with all of the records in the alias
--     target. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?>

--
-- [Elastic Beanstalk environment]
--     If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes

--     the domain name
--     @my-environment.@/@us-west-2@/@.elasticbeanstalk.com@ is a
--     regionalized domain name.
--
--     For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain
--     name doesn\'t include the region. To route traffic to these
--     environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias
--     record. Note that you can\'t create a CNAME record for the root
--     domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you
--     can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your
--     Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can\'t create a record that
--     routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk
--     environment.
--
--     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized

-- [Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website]
--     Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you
--     created the bucket in, for example,
--     @s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com@. For more information about
--     valid values, see the table

--
-- [Another Route 53 resource record set]
--     Specify the value of the @Name@ element for a resource record set in
--     the current hosted zone.
--
--     If you\'re creating an alias record that has the same name as the
--     hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can\'t specify the domain
--     name for a record for which the value of @Type@ is @CNAME@. This is
--     because the alias record must have the same type as the record that
--     you\'re routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone
--     apex isn\'t supported even for an alias record.
aliasTarget_dNSName :: Lens.Lens' AliasTarget Prelude.Text
aliasTarget_dNSName = Lens.lens (\AliasTarget' {dNSName} -> dNSName) (\s@AliasTarget' {} a -> s {dNSName = a} :: AliasTarget)

-- | /Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
-- alias, and weighted alias resource record sets:/ When
-- @EvaluateTargetHealth@ is @true@, an alias resource record set inherits
-- the health of the referenced Amazon Web Services resource, such as an
-- ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone.
--
-- Note the following:
--
-- [CloudFront distributions]
--     You can\'t set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ when the alias
--     target is a CloudFront distribution.
--
-- [Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains]
--     If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in @DNSName@ and the
--     environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing
--     routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
--     registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically
--     contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon
--     EC2 instance.) If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@ and
--     either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer
--     itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available
--     resources that are healthy, if any.
--
--     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are
--     no special requirements.
--
-- [ELB load balancers]
--     Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:
--
--     -   __Classic Load Balancers__: If you specify an ELB Classic Load
--         Balancer in @DNSName@, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries
--         only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered
--         with the load balancer. If you set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to
--         @true@ and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load
--         balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other
--         resources.
--
--     -   __Application and Network Load Balancers__: If you specify an
--         ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
--         @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to @true@, Route 53 routes queries to the
--         load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are
--         associated with the load balancer:
--
--         -   For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered
--             healthy, every target group that contains targets must
--             contain at least one healthy target. If any target group
--             contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is
--             considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other
--             resources.
--
--         -   A target group that has no registered targets is considered
--             unhealthy.
--
--     When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic
--     Load Balancing health checks; they\'re not Route 53 health checks,
--     but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health
--     checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load
--     balancer.
--
-- [S3 buckets]
--     There are no special requirements for setting @EvaluateTargetHealth@
--     to @true@ when the alias target is an S3 bucket.
--
-- [Other records in the same hosted zone]
--     If the Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in @DNSName@ is
--     a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted
--     records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you
--     associate a health check with all of the records in the alias
--     target. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?>
