-- | The current status of the stream being described. The stream status is one of the following states:     * @CREATING@ - The stream is being created. Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and sets @StreamStatus@ to @CREATING@ .     * @DELETING@ - The stream is being deleted. The specified stream is in the @DELETING@ state until Amazon Kinesis completes the deletion.     * @ACTIVE@ - The stream exists and is ready for read and write operations or deletion. You should perform read and write operations only on an @ACTIVE@ stream.     * @UPDATING@ - Shards in the stream are being merged or split. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the @UPDATING@ state.
