    --
    -- -   APPLICATION_MISSING: The application was missing. This error code is

    --     deployment is created, but before it is started.
    --
    -- -   DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_MISSING: The deployment group was missing. This
    --     error code is most likely raised if the deployment group is deleted
    --     after the deployment is created, but before it is started.
    --
    -- -   HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too many instances to
    --     be successfully deployed within the instance health constraints
    --     specified.
    --
    -- -   HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS_INVALID: The revision cannot be successfully
    --     deployed within the instance health constraints specified.
    --
    -- -   IAM_ROLE_MISSING: The service role cannot be accessed.
    --
    -- -   IAM_ROLE_PERMISSIONS: The service role does not have the correct
    --     permissions.
    --
    -- -   INTERNAL_ERROR: There was an internal error.
    --
    -- -   NO_EC2_SUBSCRIPTION: The calling account is not subscribed to Amazon
    --     EC2.

    --     found.
    --
    -- -   OVER_MAX_INSTANCES: The maximum number of instances was exceeded.
    --
    -- -   THROTTLED: The operation was throttled because the calling account
    --     exceeded the throttling limits of one or more Amazon Web Services
    --     services.
    --
    -- -   TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.
