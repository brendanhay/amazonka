-- | Properties describing a player session. Player session objects are
-- created either by creating a player session for a specific game session,
-- or as part of a game session placement. A player session represents
-- either a player reservation for a game session (status @RESERVED@) or
-- actual player activity in a game session (status @ACTIVE@). A player
-- session object (including player data) is automatically passed to a game
-- session when the player connects to the game session and is validated.
--
-- When a player disconnects, the player session status changes to
-- @COMPLETED@. Once the session ends, the player session object is
-- retained for 30 days and then removed.
