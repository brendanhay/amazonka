-- | Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event
-- settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific
-- event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management
-- events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account,
-- CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail,
-- if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs
-- the event. If the event doesn\'t match any event selector, the trail
-- doesn\'t log the event.
--
-- You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.
--
-- You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a
-- trail.
