-- Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in
-- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531 RFC6531>. For this reason, the
-- /local part/ of a destination email address (the part of the email
-- address that precedes the \@ sign) may only contain
-- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Local-part 7-bit ASCII characters>.
-- If the /domain part/ of an address (the part after the \@ sign) contains
-- non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described
-- in <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492.html RFC3492>.
