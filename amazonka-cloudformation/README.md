## Description

AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you
leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto
Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective
applications without worrying about creating and configuring the
underlying AWS infrastructure.

With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and
dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of
resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates
and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all
dependencies between the resources for you.

For more information about this product, go to the
<http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ CloudFormation Product Page>.

Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need
additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can
find the product\'s technical documentation at
<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudformation)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
