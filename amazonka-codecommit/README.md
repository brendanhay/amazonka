## Description

AWS CodeCommit

This is the /AWS CodeCommit API Reference/. This reference provides
descriptions of the AWS CodeCommit API.

You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:

-   Repositories
-   Branches
-   Commits

For information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the /AWS CodeCommit
User Guide/.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codecommit)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

> _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen` for more information.
