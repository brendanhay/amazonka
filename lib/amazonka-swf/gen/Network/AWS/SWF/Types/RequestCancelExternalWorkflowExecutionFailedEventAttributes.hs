-- | Creates a value of 'RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rcewefeaControl' - The data attached to the event that the decider can use in subsequent workflow tasks. This data isn't sent to the workflow execution.
--
-- * 'rcewefeaRunId' - The @runId@ of the external workflow execution.
--
-- * 'rcewefeaWorkflowId' - The @workflowId@ of the external workflow to which the cancel request was to be delivered.
--
-- * 'rcewefeaCause' - The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.
--
-- * 'rcewefeaInitiatedEventId' - The ID of the @RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated@ event corresponding to the @RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution@ decision to cancel this external workflow execution. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
--
-- * 'rcewefeaDecisionTaskCompletedEventId' - The ID of the @DecisionTaskCompleted@ event corresponding to the decision task that resulted in the @RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution@ decision for this cancellation request. This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to this event.
