-- | An assertion rule enforces that, when you change a routing control
-- state, that the criteria that you set in the rule configuration is met.
-- Otherwise, the change to the routing control is not accepted. For
-- example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state
-- is On after the transaction so that traffic continues to flow to at
-- least one cell for the application. This ensures that you avoid a
-- fail-open scenario.
