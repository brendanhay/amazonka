--
-- Used by deciders to get a 'DecisionTask' from the specified decision @taskList@ . A decision task may be returned for any open workflow execution that is using the specified task list. The task includes a paginated view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider should use the workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task.
--
--
-- This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is available in the specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires, an empty result is returned. An empty result, in this context, means that a DecisionTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.
--
-- /Important:/ Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds (10 seconds higher than the timeout).
--
-- /Important:/ Because the number of workflow history events for a single workflow execution might be very large, the result returned might be split up across a number of pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional calls to @PollForDecisionTask@ using the @nextPageToken@ returned by the initial call. Note that you do /not/ call @GetWorkflowExecutionHistory@ with this @nextPageToken@ . Instead, call @PollForDecisionTask@ again.
--
-- __Access Control__
--
-- You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:
--
--     * Use a @Resource@ element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.
--
--     * Use an @Action@ element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
--
--     * Constrain the @taskList.name@ parameter by using a @Condition@ element with the @swf:taskList.name@ key to allow the action to access only certain task lists.
--
--
--
-- If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's @cause@ parameter is set to @OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED@ . For details and example IAM policies, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows> in the /Amazon SWF Developer Guide/ .
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | Creates a value of 'PollForDecisionTask' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'pfdtNextPageToken' - If a @NextPageToken@ was returned by a previous call, there are more results available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again using the returned token in @nextPageToken@ . Keep all other arguments unchanged. The configured @maximumPageSize@ determines how many results can be returned in a single call.
--
-- * 'pfdtReverseOrder' - When set to @true@ , returns the events in reverse order. By default the results are returned in ascending order of the @eventTimestamp@ of the events.
--
-- * 'pfdtMaximumPageSize' - The maximum number of results that are returned per call. @nextPageToken@ can be used to obtain futher pages of results. The default is 1000, which is the maximum allowed page size. You can, however, specify a page size /smaller/ than the maximum. This is an upper limit only; the actual number of results returned per call may be fewer than the specified maximum.
--
-- * 'pfdtIdentity' - Identity of the decider making the request, which is recorded in the DecisionTaskStarted event in the workflow history. This enables diagnostic tracing when problems arise. The form of this identity is user defined.
--
-- * 'pfdtDomain' - The name of the domain containing the task lists to poll.
--
-- * 'pfdtTaskList' - Specifies the task list to poll for decision tasks. The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a @:@ (colon), @/@ (slash), @|@ (vertical bar), or any control characters (@\u0000-\u001f@ | @\u007f-\u009f@ ). Also, it must not contain the literal string @arn@ .
