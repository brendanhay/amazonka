-- Simulate how a set of IAM policies attached to an IAM entity works with
-- a list of API operations and AWS resources to determine the policies\'
-- effective permissions. The entity can be an IAM user, group, or role. If
-- you specify a user, then the simulation also includes all of the
-- policies that are attached to groups that the user belongs to. You can
-- simulate resources that don\'t exist in your account.
--
-- You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies
-- specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to
-- simulate only policies specified as strings, use SimulateCustomPolicy
-- instead.
--
-- You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be
-- evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation.
--
-- The simulation does not perform the API operations; it only checks the
-- authorization to determine if the simulated policies allow or deny the
-- operations.
--
-- __Note:__ This operation discloses information about the permissions
-- granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user\'s
-- permissions, then consider allowing them to use SimulateCustomPolicy
-- instead.
--
-- Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that
-- provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use
-- the @Condition@ element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To
-- get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct
-- simulation, use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy.
--
-- If the output is long, you can use the @MaxItems@ and @Marker@
-- parameters to paginate the results.
--
-- For more information about using the policy simulator, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html Testing IAM policies with the IAM policy simulator>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions
-- boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can
-- input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this
-- operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in

-- an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using
-- this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the
-- simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see

-- | Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that
-- support resource-based policies require different combinations of
-- resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the
-- policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to
-- ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match
-- one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The
-- following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the
-- resources that you must define to run the simulation.
--
-- Each of the EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and
-- security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then
-- you must specify that volume as a resource. If the EC2 scenario includes
-- VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes
-- an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more
-- information on the EC2 scenario options, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html Supported platforms>

-- of the API operations. If you do not specify a @CallerArn@, it defaults
-- to the ARN of the user that you specify in @PolicySourceArn@, if you
-- specified a user. If you include both a @PolicySourceArn@ (for example,
-- @arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user\/David@) and a @CallerArn@ (for example,
-- @arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user\/Bob@), the result is that you simulate
-- calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David\'s policies.
--
-- You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN
-- of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.
--
-- @CallerArn@ is required if you include a @ResourcePolicy@ and the
-- @PolicySourceArn@ is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so
-- that the resource-based policy\'s @Principal@ element has a value to use
-- in evaluating the policy.
