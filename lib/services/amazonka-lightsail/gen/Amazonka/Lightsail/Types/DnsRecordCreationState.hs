-- | Describes the creation state of the canonical name (CNAME) records that
-- are automatically added by Amazon Lightsail to the DNS of a domain to
-- validate domain ownership for an SSL\/TLS certificate.
--
-- When you create an SSL\/TLS certificate for a Lightsail resource, you
-- must add a set of CNAME records to the DNS of the domains for the
-- certificate to validate that you own the domains. Lightsail can
-- automatically add the CNAME records to the DNS of the domain if the DNS
-- zone for the domain exists within your Lightsail account. If automatic
-- record addition fails, or if you manage the DNS of your domain using a
-- third-party service, then you must manually add the CNAME records to the
-- DNS of your domain. For more information, see
-- <https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/verify-tls-ssl-certificate-using-dns-cname-https Verify an SSL\/TLS certificate in Amazon Lightsail>
