-- Records a @WorkflowExecutionTerminated@ event and forces closure of the
-- workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and
-- workflowId. The child policy, registered with the workflow type or
-- specified when starting this execution, is applied to any open child
-- workflow executions of this workflow execution.
--
-- If the identified workflow execution was in progress, it is terminated
-- immediately.
--
-- If a runId isn\'t specified, then the @WorkflowExecutionTerminated@
-- event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the
-- matching workflowId in the domain.
--
-- You should consider using RequestCancelWorkflowExecution action instead
-- because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while
-- TerminateWorkflowExecution doesn\'t.
--
-- __Access Control__
--
-- You can use IAM policies to control this action\'s access to Amazon SWF
-- resources as follows:
--
-- -   Use a @Resource@ element with the domain name to limit the action to
--     only specified domains.
--
-- -   Use an @Action@ element to allow or deny permission to call this
--     action.
--
-- -   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\'s parameters.
--
-- If the caller doesn\'t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
-- or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the
-- action fails. The associated event attribute\'s @cause@ parameter is set
-- to @OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED@. For details and example IAM policies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows>
-- in the /Amazon SWF Developer Guide/.
