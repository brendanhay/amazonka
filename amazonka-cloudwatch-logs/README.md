Amazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference

This is the /Amazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference/. Amazon CloudWatch
Logs enables you to monitor, store, and access your system, application,
and custom log files. This guide provides detailed information about
Amazon CloudWatch Logs actions, data types, parameters, and errors. For
detailed information about Amazon CloudWatch Logs features and their
associated API calls, go to the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.

Use the following links to get started using the /Amazon CloudWatch Logs
API Reference/:

-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html Actions>:
    An alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs actions.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html Data Types>:
    An alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs data types.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html Common Parameters>:
    Parameters that all Query actions can use.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html Common Errors>:
    Client and server errors that all actions can return.
-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html Regions and Endpoints>:
    Itemized regions and endpoints for all AWS products.

In addition to using the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API, you can also use
the following SDKs and third-party libraries to access Amazon CloudWatch
Logs programmatically.

-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjava/ AWS SDK for Java Documentation>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkfornet/ AWS SDK for .NET Documentation>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforphp/ AWS SDK for PHP Documentation>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforruby/ AWS SDK for Ruby Documentation>

Developers in the AWS developer community also provide their own
libraries, which you can find at the following AWS developer centers:

-   <http://aws.amazon.com/java/ AWS Java Developer Center>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/php/ AWS PHP Developer Center>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/python/ AWS Python Developer Center>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/ruby/ AWS Ruby Developer Center>
-   <http://aws.amazon.com/net/ AWS Windows and .NET Developer Center>

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch-logs)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
