--
-- Retrieves an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) URL for the stream. You can then
-- open the URL in a browser or media player to view the stream contents.
--
-- Both the @StreamName@ and the @StreamARN@ parameters are optional, but
-- you must specify either the @StreamName@ or the @StreamARN@ when
-- invoking this API operation.
--
-- An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
-- providing data through HLS:
--
-- -   The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
--     AAC encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1 should be
--     @V_MPEG\/ISO\/AVC@ (for h.264) or @V_MPEG\/ISO\/HEVC@ (for h.265).
--     Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be @A_AAC@.
--
-- -   Data retention must be greater than 0.
--
-- -   The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
--     the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format or HEVC for H.265
--     format
--     (<https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html MPEG-4 specification ISO\/IEC 14496-15>).
--     For information about adapting stream data to a given format, see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html NAL Adaptation Flags>.
--
-- -   The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
--     private data in the AAC format
--     (<https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html AAC specification ISO\/IEC 13818-7>).
--
-- Kinesis Video Streams HLS sessions contain fragments in the fragmented
-- MPEG-4 form (also called fMP4 or CMAF) or the MPEG-2 form (also called
-- TS chunks, which the HLS specification also supports). For more
-- information about HLS fragment types, see the
-- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23 HLS specification>.
--
-- The following procedure shows how to use HLS with Kinesis Video Streams:
--
-- 1.  Get an endpoint using
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html GetDataEndpoint>,
--     specifying @GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL@ for the @APIName@
--     parameter.
--
-- 2.  Retrieve the HLS URL using @GetHLSStreamingSessionURL@. Kinesis
--     Video Streams creates an HLS streaming session to be used for
--     accessing content in a stream using the HLS protocol.
--     @GetHLSStreamingSessionURL@ returns an authenticated URL (that
--     includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s HLS /master
--     playlist/ (the root resource needed for streaming with HLS).
--
--     Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity could
--     access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
--     Safeguard the token with the same measures that you would use with
--     your AWS credentials.
--
--     The media that is made available through the playlist consists only
--     of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
--     (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
--     is made available.
--
-- 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the HLS
--     master playlist to a media player that supports the HLS protocol.
--     Kinesis Video Streams makes the HLS media playlist, initialization
--     fragment, and media fragments available through the master playlist
--     URL. The initialization fragment contains the codec private data for
--     the stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio
--     decoder and renderer. The media fragments contain H.264-encoded
--     video frames or AAC-encoded audio samples.
--
-- 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
--     metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
--     data, it calls the following actions:
--
--     -   __GetHLSMasterPlaylist:__ Retrieves an HLS master playlist,
--         which contains a URL for the @GetHLSMediaPlaylist@ action for
--         each track, and additional metadata for the media player,
--         including estimated bitrate and resolution.
--
--     -   __GetHLSMediaPlaylist:__ Retrieves an HLS media playlist, which
--         contains a URL to access the MP4 initialization fragment with
--         the @GetMP4InitFragment@ action, and URLs to access the MP4
--         media fragments with the @GetMP4MediaFragment@ actions. The HLS
--         media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the
--         player needs to play it, such as whether the @PlaybackMode@ is
--         @LIVE@ or @ON_DEMAND@. The HLS media playlist is typically
--         static for sessions with a @PlaybackType@ of @ON_DEMAND@. The
--         HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for
--         sessions with a @PlaybackType@ of @LIVE@. There is a distinct
--         HLS media playlist for the video track and the audio track (if
--         applicable) that contains MP4 media URLs for the specific track.
--
--     -   __GetMP4InitFragment:__ Retrieves the MP4 initialization
--         fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
--         fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
--         contains the \"@fytp@\" and \"@moov@\" MP4 atoms, and the child
--         atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
--
--         The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
--         a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
--         for the stream and respective track, which the media player
--         needs to decode the media frames.
--
--     -   __GetMP4MediaFragment:__ Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
--         fragments contain the \"@moof@\" and \"@mdat@\" MP4 atoms and
--         their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s media
--         frames and their timestamps.
--
--         After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
--         session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
--         private data cause an error to be returned when those different
--         media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data
--         should not change between fragments in a session. This also
--         means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change
--         from having only video to having both audio and video.
--
--         Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
--         <https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/ Pricing>
--         for details.
--
--     -   __GetTSFragment:__ Retrieves MPEG TS fragments containing both
--         initialization and media data for all tracks in the stream.
--
--         If the @ContainerFormat@ is @MPEG_TS@, this API is used instead
--         of @GetMP4InitFragment@ and @GetMP4MediaFragment@ to retrieve
--         stream media.
--
--         Data retrieved with this action is billable. For more
--         information, see
--         <https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/ Kinesis Video Streams pricing>.
--
-- A streaming session URL must not be shared between players. The service
-- might throttle a session if multiple media players are sharing it. For
-- connection limits, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html Kinesis Video Streams Limits>.
--
-- You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
-- monitoring the @GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes@ Amazon CloudWatch
-- metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
-- Streams, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams>.
-- For pricing information, see
-- <https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/ Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing>
-- and <https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/ AWS Pricing>. Charges for both HLS
-- sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.
--
-- For more information about HLS, see
-- <https://developer.apple.com/streaming/ HTTP Live Streaming> on the
-- <https://developer.apple.com Apple Developer site>.
--
-- If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
-- media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
-- includes the following pieces of information:
--
-- -   @x-amz-ErrorType@ HTTP header – contains a more specific error type
--     in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
--
-- -   @x-amz-RequestId@ HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to
--     AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
--     Request Id.
--
-- Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
-- make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
-- under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
-- the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
-- again.
--
-- For more information, see the __Errors__ section at the bottom of this
-- topic, as well as

  { -- | Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media.
    -- Specifying the @FRAGMENTED_MP4@ container format packages the media into
    -- MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because
    -- there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option
    -- is @MPEG_TS@. HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and
    -- is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS
    -- typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS
    -- typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.
    --
    -- The default is @FRAGMENTED_MP4@.
    containerFormat :: Prelude.Maybe ContainerFormat,
    -- | Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added
    -- to the media playlists.
    --
    -- Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
    -- on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any
    -- overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector
    -- is set to @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@), the media player timeline will also have
    -- small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames
    -- in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to
    -- stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are
    -- discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to
    -- reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played
    -- immediately after the previous fragment.
    --
    -- The following modes are supported:
    --
    -- -   @ALWAYS@: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in
    --     the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of @ALWAYS@
    --     if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.
    --
    -- -   @NEVER@: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is
    --     recommended to use a value of @NEVER@ to ensure the media player
    --     timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps.
    --
    -- -   @ON_DISCONTINUITY@: a discontinuity marker is placed between
    --     fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds.
    --     For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of
    --     @ON_DISCONTINUITY@ so that the media player timeline is only reset
    --     when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a
    --     missing fragment).
    --
    -- The default is @ALWAYS@ when HLSFragmentSelector is set to
    -- @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@, and @NEVER@ when it is set to @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@.
    discontinuityMode :: Prelude.Maybe HLSDiscontinuityMode,
    -- | Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the
    -- HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead
    -- position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the
    -- playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the
    -- HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead
    -- as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful
    -- for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock
    -- time of the media.
    --
    -- The default is @NEVER@. When HLSFragmentSelector is @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@,
    -- the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when
    -- HLSFragmentSelector is @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, the timestamps will be the
    -- producer start timestamps.
    displayFragmentTimestamp :: Prelude.Maybe HLSDisplayFragmentTimestamp,
    -- | The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can
    -- be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).
    --
    -- When a session expires, no new calls to @GetHLSMasterPlaylist@,
    -- @GetHLSMediaPlaylist@, @GetMP4InitFragment@, @GetMP4MediaFragment@, or
    -- @GetTSFragment@ can be made for that session.
    --
    -- The default is 300 (5 minutes).
    expires :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural,
    -- | The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the
    -- timestamps.
    --
    -- This parameter is required if @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@ or
    -- @LIVE_REPLAY@. This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is @LIVE@. If
    -- @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@, the @FragmentSelectorType@ can be set, but the
    -- @TimestampRange@ should not be set. If @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@ or
    -- @LIVE_REPLAY@, both @FragmentSelectorType@ and @TimestampRange@ must be
    -- set.
    hLSFragmentSelector :: Prelude.Maybe HLSFragmentSelector,
    -- | The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
    -- playlists.
    --
    -- When the @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@, the most recent fragments are
    -- returned up to this value. When the @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@, the
    -- oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
    --
    -- When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
    -- media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
    -- playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
    -- it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
    -- We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3
    -- fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
    --
    -- The default is 5 fragments if @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@ or @LIVE_REPLAY@,
    -- and 1,000 if @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@.
    --
    -- The maximum value of 5,000 fragments corresponds to more than 80 minutes
    -- of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 13 hours of
    -- video on streams with 10-second fragments.
    maxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Natural,
    -- | Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
    --
    -- Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
    --
    -- -   __@LIVE@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is
    --     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
    --     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
    --     playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
    --     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
    --     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
    --     position in the playback window to display.
    --
    --     In @LIVE@ mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
    --     HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
    --     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
    --     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
    --     are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
    --     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
    --     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
    --     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
    --
    -- -   __@LIVE_REPLAY@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media
    --     playlist is updated similarly to how it is updated for @LIVE@ mode
    --     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
    --     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
    --     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
    --     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
    --     then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every two
    --     seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when
    --     an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not
    --     yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode
    --     is also useful to stream previously archived media without being
    --     limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the @ON_DEMAND@ mode.
    --
    -- -   __@ON_DEMAND@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist
    --     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
    --     specified in @MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults@. The playlist must be
    --     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
    --     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
    --     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
    --     display.
    --
    -- In all playback modes, if @FragmentSelectorType@ is
    -- @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
    -- start timestamp, the fragment that has the largest fragment number (that
    -- is, the newest fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The
    -- other fragments are not included. Fragments that have different
    -- timestamps but have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS
    -- media playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media
    -- player.
    --
    -- The default is @LIVE@.
    playbackMode :: Prelude.Maybe HLSPlaybackMode,

-- 'playbackMode', 'getHLSStreamingSessionURL_playbackMode' - Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
--
-- Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
--
-- -   __@LIVE@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is
--     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
--     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
--     playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
--     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
--     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
--     position in the playback window to display.
--
--     In @LIVE@ mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
--     HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
--     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
--     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
--     are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the
--     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
--     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the
--     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
--
-- -   __@LIVE_REPLAY@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media
--     playlist is updated similarly to how it is updated for @LIVE@ mode
--     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
--     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
--     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
--     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
--     then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every two
--     seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when
--     an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not
--     yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode
--     is also useful to stream previously archived media without being
--     limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the @ON_DEMAND@ mode.
--
-- -   __@ON_DEMAND@__ : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist
--     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
--     specified in @MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults@. The playlist must be
--     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
--     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
--     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
--     display.
--
-- In all playback modes, if @FragmentSelectorType@ is
-- @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
-- start timestamp, the fragment that has the largest fragment number (that
-- is, the newest fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The
-- other fragments are not included. Fragments that have different
-- timestamps but have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS
-- media playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media
-- player.
--
-- The default is @LIVE@.
--
-- 'streamARN', 'getHLSStreamingSessionURL_streamARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which to retrieve the
-- HLS master playlist URL.
--
-- You must specify either the @StreamName@ or the @StreamARN@.

-- URL.

-- | Specifies which format should be used for packaging the media.
-- Specifying the @FRAGMENTED_MP4@ container format packages the media into
-- MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because
-- there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option
-- is @MPEG_TS@. HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and
-- is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS
-- typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS
-- typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.
--
-- The default is @FRAGMENTED_MP4@.

-- | Specifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added
-- to the media playlists.
--
-- Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based
-- on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any
-- overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector
-- is set to @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@), the media player timeline will also have
-- small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames
-- in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to
-- stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are
-- discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to
-- reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played
-- immediately after the previous fragment.
--
-- The following modes are supported:
--
-- -   @ALWAYS@: a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in
--     the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of @ALWAYS@
--     if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.
--
-- -   @NEVER@: no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is
--     recommended to use a value of @NEVER@ to ensure the media player
--     timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps.
--
-- -   @ON_DISCONTINUITY@: a discontinuity marker is placed between
--     fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds.
--     For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of
--     @ON_DISCONTINUITY@ so that the media player timeline is only reset
--     when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a
--     missing fragment).
--
-- The default is @ALWAYS@ when HLSFragmentSelector is set to
-- @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@, and @NEVER@ when it is set to @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@.

-- | Specifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the
-- HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead
-- position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the
-- playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the
-- HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead
-- as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful
-- for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock
-- time of the media.
--
-- The default is @NEVER@. When HLSFragmentSelector is @SERVER_TIMESTAMP@,
-- the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when
-- HLSFragmentSelector is @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, the timestamps will be the
-- producer start timestamps.

-- @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@, the @FragmentSelectorType@ can be set, but the

-- | The maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media
-- playlists.
--
-- When the @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@, the most recent fragments are
-- returned up to this value. When the @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@, the
-- oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
--
-- When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS
-- media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting
-- playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
-- it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
-- We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3
-- fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
--
-- The default is 5 fragments if @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@ or @LIVE_REPLAY@,
-- and 1,000 if @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@.
--
-- The maximum value of 5,000 fragments corresponds to more than 80 minutes
