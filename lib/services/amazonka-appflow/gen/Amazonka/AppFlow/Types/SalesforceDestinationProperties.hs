  { -- | Specifies which Salesforce API is used by Amazon AppFlow when your flow
    -- transfers data to Salesforce.
    --
    -- [AUTOMATIC]
    --     The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API to use based on the
    --     number of records that your flow transfers to Salesforce. If your
    --     flow transfers fewer than 1,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses
    --     Salesforce REST API. If your flow transfers 1,000 records or more,
    --     Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0.
    --
    --     Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon
    --     AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring
    --     flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For
    --     example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to
    --     transfer 900 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day
    --     to transfer 1,100 records. For each of these flow runs, the
    --     respective Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the
    --     differences include how dates are formatted and null values are
    --     represented. Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn\'t transfer Salesforce
    --     compound fields.
    --
    --     By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both
    --     small and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent
    --     formatting in the output.
    --
    -- [BULKV2]
    --     Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs
    --     asynchronous data transfers, and it\'s optimal for large sets of
    --     data. By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes
    --     consistent output, but you optimize performance only for large data
    --     transfers.
    --
    --     Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields.
    --
    -- [REST_SYNC]
    --     Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this
    --     option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you
    --     decrease performance for large data transfers that are better suited
    --     for Bulk API 2.0. In some cases, if your flow attempts to transfer a
    --     vary large set of data, it might fail with a timed out error.
