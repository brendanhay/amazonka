-- Create a value of 'NoiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings' with all optional fields omitted.

-- Use <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens generic-lens> or <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics optics> to modify other optional fields.
--
-- The following record fields are available, with the corresponding lenses provided
-- for backwards compatibility:
--
-- 'speed', 'noiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings_speed' - The speed of the filter (higher number is faster). Low setting reduces
-- bit rate at the cost of transcode time, high setting improves transcode
-- time at the cost of bit rate.
--
-- 'aggressiveMode', 'noiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings_aggressiveMode' - Use Aggressive mode for content that has complex motion. Higher values
-- produce stronger temporal filtering. This filters highly complex scenes
-- more aggressively and creates better VQ for low bitrate outputs.
--
-- 'postTemporalSharpening', 'noiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings_postTemporalSharpening' - Optional. When you set Noise reducer (noiseReducer) to Temporal
-- (TEMPORAL), you can use this setting to apply sharpening. The default
-- behavior, Auto (AUTO), allows the transcoder to determine whether to
-- apply filtering, depending on input type and quality. When you set Noise
-- reducer to Temporal, your output bandwidth is reduced. When Post
-- temporal sharpening is also enabled, that bandwidth reduction is
-- smaller.
--
-- 'strength', 'noiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings_strength' - Specify the strength of the noise reducing filter on this output. Higher
-- values produce stronger filtering. We recommend the following value
-- ranges, depending on the result that you want: * 0-2 for complexity
-- reduction with minimal sharpness loss * 2-8 for complexity reduction
-- with image preservation * 8-16 for a high level of complexity reduction
