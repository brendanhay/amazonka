-- Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to
-- access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials
-- consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token.
-- Typically, you use @AssumeRole@ within your account or for cross-account
-- access. For a comparison of @AssumeRole@ with other API operations that
-- produce temporary credentials, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html Requesting Temporary Security Credentials>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison Comparing the Amazon Web Services STS API operations>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Permissions__
--
-- The temporary security credentials created by @AssumeRole@ can be used
-- to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following
-- exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS
-- @GetFederationToken@ or @GetSessionToken@ API operations.
--
-- (Optional) You can pass inline or managed
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session session policies>
-- to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as
-- an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy
-- Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The
-- plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies
-- can\'t exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation
-- returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session\'s permissions
-- are the intersection of the role\'s identity-based policy and the
-- session policies. You can use the role\'s temporary credentials in
-- subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the
-- account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
-- more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the
-- role that is being assumed. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session Session Policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy
-- that specifies /who/ can assume the role, and a permissions policy that
-- specifies /what/ can be done with the role. You specify the trusted
-- principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy.
--
-- To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services
-- account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined
-- in the role\'s trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy
-- states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in
-- the account.
--
-- A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
-- permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The
-- administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
-- @AssumeRole@ for the ARN of the role in the other account.
--
-- To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either
-- of the following:
--
-- -   Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call
--     @AssumeRole@ (as long as the role\'s trust policy trusts the
--     account).
--
-- -   Add the user as a principal directly in the role\'s trust policy.
--
-- You can do either because the roleâ€™s trust policy acts as an IAM
-- resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a
-- principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is
-- required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based
-- policies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html IAM Policies>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Tags__
--
-- (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags
-- are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html Passing Session Tags in STS>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass
-- session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to
-- allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
-- during role chaining. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining Chaining Roles with Session Tags>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- __Using MFA with AssumeRole__
--
-- (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information
-- when you call @AssumeRole@. This is useful for cross-account scenarios
-- to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated
-- with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust
-- policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA
-- authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information,
-- the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust
-- policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following
-- example.
--
-- @\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}@
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html Configuring MFA-Protected API Access>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/ guide.
--
-- To use MFA with @AssumeRole@, you pass values for the @SerialNumber@ and
-- @TokenCode@ parameters. The @SerialNumber@ value identifies the user\'s
-- hardware or virtual MFA device. The @TokenCode@ is the time-based
-- one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.

-- and if the @TokenCode@ value is missing or expired, the @AssumeRole@
-- call returns an \"access denied\" error.
--
-- The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a
-- sequence of six numeric digits.
--
-- 'transitiveTagKeys', 'assumeRole_transitiveTagKeys' - A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If

-- This parameter is optional. When you set session tags as transitive, the

--
-- If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are
-- passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.
--
-- 'roleArn', 'assumeRole_roleArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
--
-- 'roleSessionName', 'assumeRole_roleSessionName' - An identifier for the assumed role session.
--
-- Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same
-- role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In
-- cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be
-- logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also
