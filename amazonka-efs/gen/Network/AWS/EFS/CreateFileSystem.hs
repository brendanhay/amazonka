-- Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller\'s AWS account with the specified creation token, this operation does the following:
--
-- -   Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state \"creating\".
-- -   Returns with the description of the created file system.
--
-- Otherwise, this operation returns a 'FileSystemAlreadyExists' error with the ID of the existing file system.
--
-- For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the creation token.
--
-- The idempotent operation allows you to retry a 'CreateFileSystem' call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file system, the client can learn of its existence from the 'FileSystemAlreadyExists' error.
--
-- The 'CreateFileSystem' call returns while the file system\'s lifecycle state is still \"creating\". You can check the file system creation status by calling the < DescribeFileSystems> API, which among other things returns the file system state.
--
-- After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state to \"available\", at which point you can create one or more mount targets for the file system (< CreateMountTarget>) in your VPC. You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC via the mount target. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html Amazon EFS: How it Works>
--
-- This operation requires permission for the 'elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem' action.
