-- Deletes the recovery point specified by a recovery point ID.
--
-- If the recovery point ID belongs to a continuous backup, calling this
-- endpoint deletes the existing continuous backup and stops future
-- continuous backup.
--
-- When an IAM role\'s permissions are insufficient to call this API, the
-- service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body, but the
-- recovery point is not deleted. Instead, it enters an @EXPIRED@ state.
--
-- @EXPIRED@ recovery points can be deleted with this API once the IAM role
-- has the @iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole@ action. To learn more about adding
-- this role, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/deleting-backups.html#deleting-backups-troubleshooting Troubleshooting manual deletions>.
--
-- If the user or role is deleted or the permission within the role is
-- removed, the deletion will not be successful and will enter an @EXPIRED@
-- state.
