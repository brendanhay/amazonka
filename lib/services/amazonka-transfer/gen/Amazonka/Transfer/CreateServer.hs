    identityProviderDetails :: Prelude.Maybe IdentityProviderDetails,
    -- | The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is
    -- @SERVICE_MANAGED@, which allows you to store and access user credentials
    -- within the Transfer Family service.
    --
    -- Use @AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE@ to provide access to Active Directory groups
    -- in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active
    -- Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services
    -- using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory
    -- ID by using the @IdentityProviderDetails@ parameter.
    --
    -- Use the @API_GATEWAY@ value to integrate with an identity provider of
    -- your choosing. The @API_GATEWAY@ setting requires you to provide an
    -- Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the
    -- @IdentityProviderDetails@ parameter.
    --
    -- Use the @AWS_LAMBDA@ value to directly use an Lambda function as your

    -- @IdentityProviderDetails@ data type.
    identityProviderType :: Prelude.Maybe IdentityProviderType,
    -- | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
    -- (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for
    -- Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in
    -- your CloudWatch logs.
    loggingRole :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This
    -- string is displayed after the user authenticates.
    --
    -- The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
    postAuthenticationLoginBanner :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This

    -- following banner displays details about using the system:
    --
    -- @This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.@
    preAuthenticationLoginBanner :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The protocol settings that are configured for your server.
    --
    -- -   To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the
    --     @PassiveIp@ parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such
    --     as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.
    --
    -- -   To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to
    --     use the @SETSTAT@ command on a file that you are uploading to an
    --     Amazon S3 bucket, use the @SetStatOption@ parameter. To have the
    --     Transfer Family server ignore the @SETSTAT@ command and upload files
    --     without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the
    --     value to @ENABLE_NO_OP@. If you set the @SetStatOption@ parameter to
    --     @ENABLE_NO_OP@, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon
    --     CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making
    --     a @SETSTAT@ call.
    --
    -- -   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent,
    --     negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the
    --     @TlsSessionResumptionMode@ parameter.
    --
    -- -   @As2Transports@ indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.
    --     Currently, only HTTP is supported.
    protocolDetails :: Prelude.Maybe ProtocolDetails,
    -- | Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
    -- transfer protocol client can connect to your server\'s endpoint. The
    -- available protocols are:
    --
    -- -   @SFTP@ (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer
    --     over SSH
    --
    -- -   @FTPS@ (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
    --     encryption

    --
    -- -   If you select @FTPS@, you must choose a certificate stored in
    --     Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when
    --     clients connect to it over FTPS.
    --
    -- -   If @Protocol@ includes either @FTP@ or @FTPS@, then the
    --     @EndpointType@ must be @VPC@ and the @IdentityProviderType@ must be
    --     either @AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE@, @AWS_LAMBDA@, or @API_GATEWAY@.
    --
    -- -   If @Protocol@ includes @FTP@, then @AddressAllocationIds@ cannot be

    --     supported identity types: @SERVICE_MANAGED@,
    --     @AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE@, @AWS_LAMBDA@, or @API_GATEWAY@.
    --
    -- -   If @Protocol@ includes @AS2@, then the @EndpointType@ must be @VPC@,
    --     and domain must be Amazon S3.
    protocols :: Prelude.Maybe (Prelude.NonEmpty Protocol),
    -- | Specifies the name of the security policy that is attached to the
    -- server.
    securityPolicyName :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.
    --
    -- To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log
    -- group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:

--
-- For example,
-- @arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*@
--
-- If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can clear
-- it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an empty
-- value for this parameter in an @update-server@ call. For example:
--
-- @update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations@
--
-- 'tags', 'createServer_tags' - Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.
--
-- 'workflowDetails', 'createServer_workflowDetails' - Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution
-- role that\'s used for executing the workflow.
--
-- In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely,
-- @WorkflowDetails@ can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role)
-- for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs
-- when the server session disconnects while the file is still being
-- uploaded.

--
-- -   To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to
--     use the @SETSTAT@ command on a file that you are uploading to an

--     CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making
--     a @SETSTAT@ call.
--
-- -   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent,
--     negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the
--     @TlsSessionResumptionMode@ parameter.
--

--
-- -   If you select @FTPS@, you must choose a certificate stored in

--     clients connect to it over FTPS.
--
-- -   If @Protocol@ includes either @FTP@ or @FTPS@, then the
