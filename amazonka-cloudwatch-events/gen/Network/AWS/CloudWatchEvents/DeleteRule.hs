-- Deletes the specified rule.
--
-- Before you can delete the rule, you must remove all targets, using
-- RemoveTargets.
--
-- When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to the
-- deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
--
-- Managed rules are rules created and managed by another AWS service on
-- your behalf. These rules are created by those other AWS services to
-- support functionality in those services. You can delete these rules
-- using the @Force@ option, but you should do so only if you are sure the
-- other service is not still using that rule.
