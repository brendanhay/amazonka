description:
  Derived from API version @2016-11-28@ of the AWS service descriptions, licensed under Apache 2.0.
  .
  The types from this library are intended to be used with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>,
  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests, and receiving responses.
  .
  It is recommended to use generic lenses or optics from packages such as <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens generic-lens> or <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics optics> to modify optional fields and deconstruct responses.
  .
  Generated lenses for legacy behaviour can be found in "Network.AWS.Organizations.Lens"
  and are suitable for use with a lens package such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
  .
  Additional types and functions from <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-core amazonka-core> are re-exported by the "Network.AWS.Prelude" module in this package.
  .
  See "Network.AWS.Organizations" and the <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ AWS documentation> to get started.
