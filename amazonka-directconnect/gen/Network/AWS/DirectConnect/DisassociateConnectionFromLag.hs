-- Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The
-- connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection
-- (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the
-- DeleteConnection request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces
-- or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A
-- disassociated connection owned by an AWS Direct Connect Partner is
-- automatically converted to an interconnect.
--
-- If disassociating the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its
-- setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request
-- fails, except when it\'s the last member of the LAG. If all connections
-- are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no
-- physical connections.
