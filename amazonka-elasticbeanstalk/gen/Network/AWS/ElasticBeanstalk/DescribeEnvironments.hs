-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeEnvironments' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'desEnvironmentIds' - If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descriptions to include only those that have the specified IDs.
--
-- * 'desEnvironmentNames' - If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descriptions to include only those that have the specified names.
--
-- * 'desNextToken' - For a paginated request. Specify a token from a previous response page to retrieve the next response page. All other parameter values must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request. If no @NextToken@ is specified, the first page is retrieved.
--
-- * 'desVersionLabel' - If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descriptions to include only those that are associated with this application version.
--
-- * 'desMaxRecords' - For a paginated request. Specify a maximum number of environments to include in each response. If no @MaxRecords@ is specified, all available environments are retrieved in a single response.
--
-- * 'desApplicationName' - If specified, AWS Elastic Beanstalk restricts the returned descriptions to include only those that are associated with this application.
--
-- * 'desIncludedDeletedBackTo' - If specified when @IncludeDeleted@ is set to @true@ , then environments deleted after this date are displayed.
--
-- * 'desIncludeDeleted' - Indicates whether to include deleted environments: @true@ : Environments that have been deleted after @IncludedDeletedBackTo@ are displayed. @false@ : Do not include deleted environments.
