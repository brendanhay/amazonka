-- Modifies the parameters of a service.
--
-- For services using the rolling update (@ECS@) you can update the desired
-- count, deployment configuration, network configuration, load balancers,
-- service registries, enable ECS managed tags option, propagate tags
-- option, task placement constraints and strategies, and task definition.
-- When you update any of these parameters, Amazon ECS starts new tasks
-- with the new configuration.
--
-- For services using the blue\/green (@CODE_DEPLOY@) deployment
-- controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, health
-- check grace period, task placement constraints and strategies, enable
-- ECS managed tags option, and propagate tags can be updated using this
-- API. If the network configuration, platform version, task definition, or
-- load balancer need to be updated, create a new CodeDeploy deployment.
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html CreateDeployment>
-- in the /CodeDeploy API Reference/.
--
-- For services using an external deployment controller, you can update
-- only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies,
-- health check grace period, enable ECS managed tags option, and propagate
-- tags option, using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network
-- configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated,
-- create a new task set For more information, see CreateTaskSet.
--
-- You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task
-- definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is
-- running in and a new @desiredCount@ parameter.
--
-- If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create
-- a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The
-- service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent
-- parameters (in the service\'s deployment configuration) to determine the
-- deployment strategy.
--
-- If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the
-- existing task definition for your service (for example,
-- @my_image:latest@), you don\'t need to create a new revision of your
-- task definition. You can update the service using the
-- @forceNewDeployment@ option. The new tasks launched by the deployment
-- pull the current image\/tag combination from your repository when they
-- start.
--
-- You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a
-- deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service,
-- the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters,
-- @minimumHealthyPercent@ and @maximumPercent@, to determine the
-- deployment strategy.
--
-- -   If @minimumHealthyPercent@ is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore
--     @desiredCount@ temporarily during a deployment. For example, if
--     @desiredCount@ is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler
--     to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
--     services that don\'t use a load balancer are considered healthy if
--     they\'re in the @RUNNING@ state. Tasks for services that use a load
--     balancer are considered healthy if they\'re in the @RUNNING@ state
--     and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
--
-- -   The @maximumPercent@ parameter represents an upper limit on the
--     number of running tasks during a deployment. You can use it to
--     define the deployment batch size. For example, if @desiredCount@ is
--     four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping
--     the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required
--     to do this are available).
--
-- When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of
-- @docker stop@ is issued to the containers running in the task. This
-- results in a @SIGTERM@ and a 30-second timeout. After this, @SIGKILL@ is
-- sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles
-- the @SIGTERM@ gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it,
-- no @SIGKILL@ is sent.
--
-- When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
-- placement in your cluster with the following logic.
--
-- -   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can
--     support your service\'s task definition. For example, they have the
--     required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes.
--
-- -   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
--     Availability Zones in this manner even though you can choose a
--     different placement strategy.
--
--     -   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of
--         running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as
--         the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service
--         task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances
--         in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
--
--     -   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an
--         optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps),
--         favoring container instances with the fewest number of running
--         tasks for this service.
--
-- When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain
-- balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the
-- following logic:
--
-- -   Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks
--     for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
--     example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C
--     each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are
--     considered optimal for termination.
--
-- -   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability
--     Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances
--     with the largest number of running tasks for this service.
--
-- You must have a service-linked role when you update any of the following
-- service properties. If you specified a custom role when you created the
-- service, Amazon ECS automatically replaces the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_Service.html#ECS-Type-Service-roleArn roleARN>
-- associated with the service with the ARN of your service-linked role.
-- For more information, see

    --
    -- if the service uses the default capacity provider strategy for the

    -- A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
    -- along with the @base@ and @weight@ to assign to them. A capacity
    -- provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity
    -- provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
    -- associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers
    -- with an @ACTIVE@ or @UPDATING@ status can be used.
    --
    -- If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
    -- capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be
    -- created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
    --
    -- To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the @FARGATE@ or
    -- @FARGATE_SPOT@ capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
    -- available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster

-- | The capacity provider strategy to update the service to use.
--
-- if the service uses the default capacity provider strategy for the
-- cluster, the service can be updated to use one or more capacity
-- providers as opposed to the default capacity provider strategy. However,
-- when a service is using a capacity provider strategy that\'s not the
-- default capacity provider strategy, the service can\'t be updated to use
-- the cluster\'s default capacity provider strategy.
--
-- A capacity provider strategy consists of one or more capacity providers
-- along with the @base@ and @weight@ to assign to them. A capacity
-- provider must be associated with the cluster to be used in a capacity
-- provider strategy. The PutClusterCapacityProviders API is used to
-- associate a capacity provider with a cluster. Only capacity providers
-- with an @ACTIVE@ or @UPDATING@ status can be used.
--
-- If specifying a capacity provider that uses an Auto Scaling group, the
-- capacity provider must already be created. New capacity providers can be
-- created with the CreateCapacityProvider API operation.
--
-- To use a Fargate capacity provider, specify either the @FARGATE@ or
-- @FARGATE_SPOT@ capacity providers. The Fargate capacity providers are
-- available to all accounts and only need to be associated with a cluster
-- to be used.
--
-- The PutClusterCapacityProviders API operation is used to update the list
-- of available capacity providers for a cluster after the cluster is
-- created.
