--
-- This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive
-- parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload
-- up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload.
--
-- Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following
-- conditions is true:
--
-- -   __SHA256 tree hash does not match__To ensure that part data is not
--     corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the
--     part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data,
--     Amazon Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash
--     values don\'t match, the operation fails. For information about
--     computing a SHA256 tree hash, see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html Computing Checksums>.
--
-- -   __Part size does not match__The size of each part except the last
--     must match the size specified in the corresponding
--     InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be
--     the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.
--
--     If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you
--     specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is
--     not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed.
--     However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.
--
-- -   __Range does not align__The byte range value in the request does not
--     align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate
--     request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4
--     MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to
--     8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a
--     range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part
--     size and the upload will fail.
--
-- This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple
-- times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the
-- previously uploaded data.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
