-- Describes the specified instances or all instances.
--
-- If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only
-- the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes
-- information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If
-- you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes
-- information for all instances, which can affect performance. We
-- recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns
-- quickly and successfully.
--
-- If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned.
-- If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in
-- the output.
--
-- Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This
-- interval is usually less than one hour.
--
-- If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is
-- experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are
-- in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the
-- call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that
-- are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- 'reservations', 'describeInstancesResponse_reservations' - Information about the reservations.

-- 'httpStatus', 'describeInstancesResponse_httpStatus' - The response's http status code.
