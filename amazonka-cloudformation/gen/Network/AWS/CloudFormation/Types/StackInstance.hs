-- | An AWS CloudFormation stack, in a specific account and Region, that\'s
-- part of a stack set operation. A stack instance is a reference to an
-- attempted or actual stack in a given account within a given Region. A
-- stack instance can exist without a stackâ€”for example, if the stack
-- couldn\'t be created for some reason. A stack instance is associated
-- with only one stack set. Each stack instance contains the ID of its
-- associated stack set, as well as the ID of the actual stack and the
-- stack status.
