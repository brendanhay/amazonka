-- Deletes one or more specified VPC endpoints. You can delete any of the
-- following types of VPC endpoints.
--
-- -   Gateway endpoint,
--
-- -   Gateway Load Balancer endpoint,
--
-- -   Interface endpoint
--
-- The following rules apply when you delete a VPC endpoint:
--
-- -   When you delete a gateway endpoint, we delete the endpoint routes in
--     the route tables that are associated with the endpoint.
--
-- -   When you delete a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, we delete the
--     endpoint network interfaces.
--
--     You can only delete Gateway Load Balancer endpoints when the routes
--     that are associated with the endpoint are deleted.
--
-- -   When you delete an interface endpoint, we delete the endpoint
--     network interfaces.
