--
-- Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified
-- collection.
--
-- Amazon Rekognition doesn\'t save the actual faces that are detected.
-- Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in
-- the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features
-- into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon
-- Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search
-- operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations.
--
-- For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon
-- Rekognition Developer Guide.
--
-- To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.
--
-- If you\'re using version 1.0 of the face detection model, @IndexFaces@
-- indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the
-- face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.
--
-- If you\'re using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation
-- information is not returned in the @OrientationCorrection@ field.
--
-- To determine which version of the model you\'re using, call
-- DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the
-- model version from the value of @FaceModelVersion@ in the response from
-- @IndexFaces@
--
-- For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition
-- Developer Guide.
--
-- If you provide the optional @ExternalImageId@ for the input image you
-- provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it
-- detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the
-- external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side
-- index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index
-- to find all faces in an image.
--
-- You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the @MaxFaces@
-- input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces
-- in an image and don\'t want to index smaller faces, such as those
-- belonging to people standing in the background.
--
-- The @QualityFilter@ input parameter allows you to filter out detected
-- faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based
-- on a variety of common use cases. By default, @IndexFaces@ chooses the
-- quality bar that\'s used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose
-- the quality bar. Use @QualityFilter@, to set the quality bar by
-- specifying @LOW@, @MEDIUM@, or @HIGH@. If you do not want to filter
-- detected faces, specify @NONE@.
--
-- To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version
-- 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model
-- associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.
--
-- Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is
-- returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, @UnindexedFaces@. Faces
-- aren\'t indexed for reasons such as:
--
-- -   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the @MaxFaces@
--     request parameter.
--
-- -   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.
--
-- -   The face is too blurry.
--
-- -   The image is too dark.
--
-- -   The face has an extreme pose.
--
-- -   The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.
--
-- In response, the @IndexFaces@ operation returns an array of metadata for
-- all detected faces, @FaceRecords@. This includes:
--
-- -   The bounding box, @BoundingBox@, of the detected face.
--
-- -   A confidence value, @Confidence@, which indicates the confidence
--     that the bounding box contains a face.
--
-- -   A face ID, @FaceId@, assigned by the service for each face that\'s
--     detected and stored.
--
-- -   An image ID, @ImageId@, assigned by the service for the input image.
--
-- If you request all facial attributes (by using the @detectionAttributes@
-- parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such
-- as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other
-- facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same
-- collection, and use the same external ID in the @IndexFaces@ operation,
-- Amazon Rekognition doesn\'t save duplicate face metadata.
--
-- The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a
-- reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to
-- call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn\'t
-- supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the
-- @rekognition:IndexFaces@ action.

--     metadata, Amazon Rekognition returns an estimated orientation
--     (ROTATE_0, ROTATE_90, ROTATE_180, ROTATE_270). Amazon Rekognition
