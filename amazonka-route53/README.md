## Description

Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It
provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses
Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your
infrastructure outside of AWS.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-route53)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
