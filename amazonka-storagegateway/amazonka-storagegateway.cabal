    AWS Storage Gateway Service

    AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software
    appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
    integration between an organization\'s on-premises IT environment and
    AWS\'s storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely
    upload data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid
    disaster recovery.

    Use the following links to get started using the /AWS Storage Gateway
    Service API Reference/:

    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers>:
        Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST
        request to AWS Storage Gateway.
    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html Signing Requests>:
        AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you
        send; this topic describes how sign such a request.
    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/APIErrorResponses.html Error Responses>:
        Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.
    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html Operations in AWS Storage Gateway>:
        Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway
        operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible
        errors, and examples of requests and responses.
    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints>:
        Provides a list of each of the regions and endpoints available for
        use with AWS Storage Gateway.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.StorageGateway" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
