-- An intentionally limited set of prelude exports to control backward
-- compatibility and simplify code generation.
--
-- Please consider long and hard before adding any addtional types exports to
-- this module - they should either be in pervasive use throughout the project
-- or have zero ambiguity. If you ever are forced to disambiguate at any point,
-- it's a bad export.
--
-- Try and avoid any value, operator, or symbol exports, if possible. Most of
-- the ones here exist to ease legacy code-migration.
