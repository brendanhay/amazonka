--
-- This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a
-- single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to
-- delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending
-- individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.
--
-- The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete.
-- In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version
-- IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a
-- versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete
-- action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in
-- the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not
-- found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.
--
-- The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By
-- default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the
-- result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the
-- response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an
-- error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any
-- information about the delete in the response body.
--
-- When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that
-- attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token.
-- If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there
-- are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an
-- invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not,
-- the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about
-- MFA Delete, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete MFA Delete>.
--
-- Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete
-- requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request
-- body has not been altered in transit.
