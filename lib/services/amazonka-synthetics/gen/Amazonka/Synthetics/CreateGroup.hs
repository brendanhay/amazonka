-- Creates a group which you can use to associate canaries with each other,
-- including cross-Region canaries. Using groups can help you with managing
-- and automating your canaries, and you can also view aggregated run
-- results and statistics for all canaries in a group.
--
-- Groups are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated
-- across Amazon Web Services Regions, and you can view it and add canaries
-- to it from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region
-- name where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region.
-- This means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same
-- group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries
-- in a single view.
--
-- Groups are supported in all Regions except the Regions that are disabled
-- by default. For more information about these Regions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable Enabling a Region>.
--
-- Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries. You can have as many as
-- 20 groups in your account. Any single canary can be a member of up to 10
-- groups.
