-- Deletes a Kinesis data stream and all its shards and data. You must shut
-- down any applications that are operating on the stream before you delete
-- the stream. If an application attempts to operate on a deleted stream,
-- it receives the exception @ResourceNotFoundException@.
--
-- If the stream is in the @ACTIVE@ state, you can delete it. After a
-- @DeleteStream@ request, the specified stream is in the @DELETING@ state
-- until Kinesis Data Streams completes the deletion.
--
-- __Note:__ Kinesis Data Streams might continue to accept data read and
-- write operations, such as PutRecord, PutRecords, and GetRecords, on a
-- stream in the @DELETING@ state until the stream deletion is complete.
--
-- When you delete a stream, any shards in that stream are also deleted,
-- and any tags are dissociated from the stream.
--
-- You can use the DescribeStream operation to check the state of the
-- stream, which is returned in @StreamStatus@.
--
-- DeleteStream has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
