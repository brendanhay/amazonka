--
-- Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
-- to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation
-- to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide
-- instructions for running game servers on each instance.
--
-- Most Amazon GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations,
-- including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional
-- set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following Amazon
-- Web Services Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N.
-- Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1
-- (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and
-- ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other Amazon GameLift
-- Regions can deploy instances in the fleet\'s home Region only. All fleet
-- instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however,
-- you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on\/off for each
-- location.
--
-- To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a
-- game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime
-- configuration to direct Amazon GameLift how to start and run game
-- servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound
-- traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed.
-- When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional
-- remote locations.
--
-- If you need to debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or
-- other actions on the fleet, create the development fleet with port
-- 22\/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote
-- access only when you need them and closing them when you\'re finished.
--
-- If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it
-- in @NEW@ status, which prompts Amazon GameLift to initiate the
