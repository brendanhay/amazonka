-- Gets a list of all of the context keys referenced in all the IAM
-- policies that are attached to the specified IAM entity. The entity can
-- be an IAM user, group, or role. If you specify a user, then the request
-- also includes all of the policies attached to groups that the user is a
-- member of.
--
-- You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies,
-- specified as strings. If you want to include /only/ a list of policies
-- by string, use GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.
--
-- __Note:__ This operation discloses information about the permissions
-- granted to other users. If you do not want users to see other user\'s
-- permissions, then consider allowing them to use
-- GetContextKeysForCustomPolicy instead.
--
-- Context keys are variables maintained by AWS and its services that
-- provide details about the context of an API query request. Context keys
-- can be evaluated by testing against a value in an IAM policy. Use
-- GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy to understand what key names and values
-- you must supply when you call SimulatePrincipalPolicy.
