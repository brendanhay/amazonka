-- Creates a Amazon Kinesis stream. A stream captures and transports data
-- records that are continuously emitted from different data sources or
-- /producers/. Scale-out within an Amazon Kinesis stream is explicitly
-- supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of
-- data records in an Amazon Kinesis stream.
--
-- You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed
-- of. Each open shard can support up to 5 read transactions per second, up
-- to a maximum total of 2 MB of data read per second. Each shard can
-- support up to 1000 records written per second, up to a maximum total of
-- 1 MB data written per second. You can add shards to a stream if the
-- amount of data input increases and you can remove shards if the amount
-- of data input decreases.
--
-- The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS
-- account used by the application. It is also scoped by region. That is,
-- two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two
-- streams in the same account, but in two different regions, can have the
-- same name.
--
-- 'CreateStream' is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a
-- 'CreateStream' request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and sets the
-- stream status to 'CREATING'. After the stream is created, Amazon Kinesis
-- sets the stream status to 'ACTIVE'. You should perform read and write
-- operations only on an 'ACTIVE' stream.
--
-- You receive a 'LimitExceededException' when making a 'CreateStream'
-- request if you try to do one of the following:
--
-- -   Have more than five streams in the 'CREATING' state at any point in
--     time.
-- -   Create more shards than are authorized for your account.
--
-- For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html Amazon Kinesis Limits>.
-- If you need to increase this limit,
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html contact AWS Support>
--
-- You can use 'DescribeStream' to check the stream status, which is
-- returned in 'StreamStatus'.
--
-- CreateStream has a limit of 5 transactions per second per account.
