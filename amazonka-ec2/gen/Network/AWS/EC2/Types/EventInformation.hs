    -- The following are the @error@ events:
    --
    -- -   @iamFleetRoleInvalid@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet did not have the
    --     required permissions either to launch or terminate an instance.
    --
    -- -   @spotFleetRequestConfigurationInvalid@ - The configuration is not
    --     valid. For more information, see the description of the event.
    --
    -- -   @spotInstanceCountLimitExceeded@ - You\'ve reached the limit on the
    --     number of Spot Instances that you can launch.
    --
    -- The following are the @fleetRequestChange@ events:
    --
    -- -   @active@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has been validated
    --     and Amazon EC2 is attempting to maintain the target number of
    --     running Spot Instances.
    --
    -- -   @cancelled@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is canceled and
    --     has no running Spot Instances. The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet will be
    --     deleted two days after its instances were terminated.
    --
    -- -   @cancelled_running@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is
    --     canceled and does not launch additional Spot Instances. Existing
    --     Spot Instances continue to run until they are interrupted or
    --     terminated.
    --
    -- -   @cancelled_terminating@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is
    --     canceled and its Spot Instances are terminating.
    --
    -- -   @expired@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request has expired. A
    --     subsequent event indicates that the instances were terminated, if
    --     the request was created with @TerminateInstancesWithExpiration@ set.
    --
    -- -   @modify_in_progress@ - A request to modify the EC2 Fleet or Spot
    --     Fleet request was accepted and is in progress.
    --
    -- -   @modify_successful@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request was
    --     modified.
    --
    -- -   @price_update@ - The price for a launch configuration was adjusted
    --     because it was too high. This change is permanent.
    --
    -- -   @submitted@ - The EC2 Fleet or Spot Fleet request is being evaluated
    --     and Amazon EC2 is preparing to launch the target number of Spot
    --     Instances.
    --
    -- The following are the @instanceChange@ events:
    --
    -- -   @launched@ - A request was fulfilled and a new instance was
    --     launched.
    --
    -- -   @terminated@ - An instance was terminated by the user.
    --
    -- The following are the @Information@ events:
    --
    -- -   @launchSpecTemporarilyBlacklisted@ - The configuration is not valid
    --     and several attempts to launch instances have failed. For more
    --     information, see the description of the event.
    --
    -- -   @launchSpecUnusable@ - The price in a launch specification is not
    --     valid because it is below the Spot price or the Spot price is above
    --     the On-Demand price.
    --
    -- -   @fleetProgressHalted@ - The price in every launch specification is
    --     not valid. A launch specification might become valid if the Spot
    --     price changes.
