-- Retrieves an MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
-- the stream. You can then open the URL in a media player to view the
-- stream contents.
--
-- Both the @StreamName@ and the @StreamARN@ parameters are optional, but
-- you must specify either the @StreamName@ or the @StreamARN@ when
-- invoking this API operation.
--
-- An Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for
-- providing data through MPEG-DASH:
--
-- -   The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and, optionally,
--     AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1
--     should be @V_MPEG\/ISO\/AVC@ (for h.264) or V_MPEGH\/ISO\/HEVC (for
--     H.265). Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be @A_AAC@ (for
--     AAC) or A_MS\/ACM (for G.711).
--
-- -   Data retention must be greater than 0.
--
-- -   The video track of each fragment must contain codec private data in
--     the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265
--     format. For more information, see
--     <https://www.iso.org/standard/55980.html MPEG-4 specification ISO\/IEC 14496-15>.
--     For information about adapting stream data to a given format, see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/producer-reference-nal.html NAL Adaptation Flags>.
--
-- -   The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec
--     private data in the AAC format
--     (<https://www.iso.org/standard/43345.html AAC specification ISO\/IEC 13818-7>)
--     or the
--     <http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html MS Wave format>.
--
-- The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with Kinesis Video
-- Streams:
--
-- 1.  Get an endpoint using
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_GetDataEndpoint.html GetDataEndpoint>,
--     specifying @GET_DASH_STREAMING_SESSION_URL@ for the @APIName@
--     parameter.
--
-- 2.  Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using @GetDASHStreamingSessionURL@.
--     Kinesis Video Streams creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be
--     used for accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.
--     @GetDASHStreamingSessionURL@ returns an authenticated URL (that
--     includes an encrypted session token) for the session\'s MPEG-DASH
--     /manifest/ (the root resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).
--
--     Don\'t share or store this token where an unauthorized entity can
--     access it. The token provides access to the content of the stream.
--     Safeguard the token with the same measures that you use with your
--     AWS credentials.
--
--     The media that is made available through the manifest consists only
--     of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
--     (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate bitrates)
--     is made available.
--
-- 3.  Provide the URL (containing the encrypted session token) for the
--     MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH
--     protocol. Kinesis Video Streams makes the initialization fragment
--     and media fragments available through the manifest URL. The
--     initialization fragment contains the codec private data for the
--     stream, and other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder
--     and renderer. The media fragments contain encoded video frames or
--     encoded audio samples.
--
-- 4.  The media player receives the authenticated URL and requests stream
--     metadata and media data normally. When the media player requests
--     data, it calls the following actions:
--
--     -   __GetDASHManifest:__ Retrieves an MPEG DASH manifest, which
--         contains the metadata for the media that you want to playback.
--
--     -   __GetMP4InitFragment:__ Retrieves the MP4 initialization
--         fragment. The media player typically loads the initialization
--         fragment before loading any media fragments. This fragment
--         contains the \"@fytp@\" and \"@moov@\" MP4 atoms, and the child
--         atoms that are needed to initialize the media player decoder.
--
--         The initialization fragment does not correspond to a fragment in
--         a Kinesis video stream. It contains only the codec private data
--         for the stream and respective track, which the media player
--         needs to decode the media frames.
--
--     -   __GetMP4MediaFragment:__ Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These
--         fragments contain the \"@moof@\" and \"@mdat@\" MP4 atoms and
--         their child atoms, containing the encoded fragment\'s media
--         frames and their timestamps.
--
--         After the first media fragment is made available in a streaming
--         session, any fragments that don\'t contain the same codec
--         private data cause an error to be returned when those different
--         media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the codec private data
--         should not change between fragments in a session. This also
--         means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream change
--         from having only video to having both audio and video.
--
--         Data retrieved with this action is billable. See
--         <https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/ Pricing>
--         for details.
--
-- For restrictions that apply to MPEG-DASH sessions, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/limits.html Kinesis Video Streams Limits>.
--
-- You can monitor the amount of data that the media player consumes by
-- monitoring the @GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes@ Amazon CloudWatch
-- metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
-- Streams, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/monitoring.html Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams>.
-- For pricing information, see
-- <https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/pricing/ Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing>
-- and <https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/ AWS Pricing>. Charges for both HLS
-- sessions and outgoing AWS data apply.
--
-- For more information about HLS, see
-- <https://developer.apple.com/streaming/ HTTP Live Streaming> on the
-- <https://developer.apple.com Apple Developer site>.
--
-- If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived
-- media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it
-- includes the following pieces of information:
--
-- -   @x-amz-ErrorType@ HTTP header – contains a more specific error type
--     in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.
--
-- -   @x-amz-RequestId@ HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to
--     AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
--     Request Id.
--
-- Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to
-- make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and
-- under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions
-- the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try
-- again.
--
-- For more information, see the __Errors__ section at the bottom of this
-- topic, as well as

    --
    -- Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
    --
    -- -   __@LIVE@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is
    --     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
    --     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
    --     manifest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
    --     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
    --     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
    --     position in the playback window to display.
    --
    --     In @LIVE@ mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
    --     MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
    --     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
    --     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
    --     are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the
    --     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
    --     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the manifest, the
    --     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
    --
    -- -   __@LIVE_REPLAY@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH
    --     manifest is updated similarly to how it is updated for @LIVE@ mode
    --     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
    --     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
    --     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
    --     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
    --     then a new fragment is added to the manifest every two seconds. This
    --     mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is
    --     detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been
    --     ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also
    --     useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by
    --     the 1,000 fragment limit in the @ON_DEMAND@ mode.
    --
    -- -   __@ON_DEMAND@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest
    --     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
    --     specified in @MaxManifestFragmentResults@. The manifest must be
    --     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
    --     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
    --     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
    --     display.
    --
    -- In all playback modes, if @FragmentSelectorType@ is
    -- @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
    -- start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
    -- is, the newer fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other
    -- fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
    -- have overlapping durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest.
    -- This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.
    --
    -- The default is @LIVE@.

-- manifest.
--
-- When the @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@, the most recent fragments are
-- returned up to this value. When the @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@, the
-- oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.
--
-- When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live
-- MPEG-DASH manifest, video players often buffer content before starting
-- playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but
-- it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback.
-- We recommend that a live MPEG-DASH manifest have a minimum of 3
-- fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.
--
-- The default is 5 fragments if @PlaybackMode@ is @LIVE@ or @LIVE_REPLAY@,
-- and 1,000 if @PlaybackMode@ is @ON_DEMAND@.
--
-- The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes
-- of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1\/2 hours
-- of video on streams with 10-second fragments.

-- | Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.
--
-- Features of the three types of sessions include the following:
--
-- -   __@LIVE@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is
--     continually updated with the latest fragments as they become
--     available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new
--     manifest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is
--     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
--     \"live\" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the
--     position in the playback window to display.
--
--     In @LIVE@ mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
--     MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is a gap between fragments (that
--     is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media
--     player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments
--     are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the
--     newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes
--     available after a subsequent fragment is added to the manifest, the
--     older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.
--
-- -   __@LIVE_REPLAY@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH
--     manifest is updated similarly to how it is updated for @LIVE@ mode
--     except that it starts by including fragments from a given start
--     time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested,
--     fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses.
--     For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long,
--     then a new fragment is added to the manifest every two seconds. This
--     mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is
--     detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been
--     ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also
--     useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by
--     the 1,000 fragment limit in the @ON_DEMAND@ mode.
--
-- -   __@ON_DEMAND@__ : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest
--     contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is
--     specified in @MaxManifestFragmentResults@. The manifest must be
--     retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
--     played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a
--     scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to
--     display.
--
-- In all playback modes, if @FragmentSelectorType@ is
-- @PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP@, and if there are multiple fragments with the same
-- start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that
-- is, the newer fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other
-- fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but
-- have overlapping durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest.
-- This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.
--
-- The default is @LIVE@.
