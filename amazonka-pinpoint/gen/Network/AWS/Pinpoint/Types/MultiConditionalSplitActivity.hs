-- | Specifies the settings for a multivariate split activity in a journey.
-- This type of activity sends participants down one of as many as five
-- paths (including a default /Else/ path) in a journey, based on
-- conditions that you specify.
--
-- To create multivariate split activities that send participants down
-- different paths based on push notification events (such as Open or
-- Received events), your mobile app has to specify the User ID and
-- Endpoint ID values. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/integrate.html Integrating Amazon Pinpoint with your application>
-- in the /Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide/.
