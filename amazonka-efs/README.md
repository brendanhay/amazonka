## Version

`1.3.0`


## Description

Amazon Elastic File System

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-efs)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticfilesystem/latest/devguide/welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
