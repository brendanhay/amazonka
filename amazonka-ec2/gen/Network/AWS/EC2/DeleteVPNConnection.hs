-- Deletes the specified VPN connection.
--
-- If you\'re deleting the VPC and its associated components, we recommend
-- that you detach the virtual private gateway from the VPC and delete the
-- VPC before deleting the VPN connection. If you believe that the tunnel
-- credentials for your VPN connection have been compromised, you can
-- delete the VPN connection and create a new one that has new keys,
-- without needing to delete the VPC or virtual private gateway. If you
-- create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway
-- using the new configuration information returned with the new VPN
-- connection ID.
