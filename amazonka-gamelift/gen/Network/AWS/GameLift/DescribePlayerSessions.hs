-- Retrieves properties for one or more player sessions. This action can be used in several ways: (1) provide a /PlayerSessionId/ parameter to request properties for a specific player session; (2) provide a /GameSessionId/ parameter to request properties for all player sessions in the specified game session; (3) provide a /PlayerId/ parameter to request properties for all player sessions of a specified player.
--
-- To get game session record(s), specify only one of the following: a player session ID, a game session ID, or a player ID. You can filter this request by player session status. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a < PlayerSession> object is returned for each session matching the request.
