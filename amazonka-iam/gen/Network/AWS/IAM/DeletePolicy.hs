-- Deletes the specified managed policy.
--
-- Before you can delete a managed policy, you must detach the policy from
-- all users, groups, and roles that it is attached to, and you must delete
-- all of the policy\'s versions. The following steps describe the process
-- for deleting a managed policy:
--
-- 1.  Detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy
--     is attached to, using the DetachUserPolicy, DetachGroupPolicy, or
--     DetachRolePolicy APIs. To list all the users, groups, and roles that
--     a policy is attached to, use ListEntitiesForPolicy.
-- 2.  Delete all versions of the policy using DeletePolicyVersion. To list
--     the policy\'s versions, use ListPolicyVersions. You cannot use
--     DeletePolicyVersion to delete the version that is marked as the
--     default version. You delete the policy\'s default version in the
--     next step of the process.
-- 3.  Delete the policy (this automatically deletes the policy\'s default
--     version) using this API.
