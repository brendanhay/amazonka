--
-- * 'lsnPortInformationNeeded' - Flag to indicate if port and protocol information is needed as part of the response.
--
-- * 'lsnNeighborConfigurationIds' - List of configuration IDs to test for one-hop-away.
--
-- * 'lsnNextToken' - Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you previously specified 100 IDs for @ListServerNeighborsRequest$neighborConfigurationIds@ but set @ListServerNeighborsRequest$maxResults@ to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next set of 10.
--
-- * 'lsnMaxResults' - Maximum number of results to return in a single page of output.
--
-- * 'lsnConfigurationId' - Configuration ID of the server for which neighbors are being listed.
