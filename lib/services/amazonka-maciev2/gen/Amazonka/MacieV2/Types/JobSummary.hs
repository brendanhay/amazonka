    --     jobs.
    --

-- created.
--
-- 'jobId', 'jobSummary_jobId' - The unique identifier for the job.
--
-- 'jobStatus', 'jobSummary_jobStatus' - The current status of the job. Possible values are:
--
-- -   CANCELLED - You cancelled the job or, if it\'s a one-time job, you
--     paused the job and didn\'t resume it within 30 days.
--
-- -   COMPLETE - For a one-time job, Amazon Macie finished processing the

--
-- 'lastRunErrorStatus', 'jobSummary_lastRunErrorStatus' - Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access errors occurred

--
-- 'name', 'jobSummary_name' - The custom name of the job.
