## Description

AWS Lambda

__Overview__

This is the /AWS Lambda API Reference/. The AWS Lambda Developer Guide
provides additional information. For the service overview, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html What is AWS Lambda>,
and for information about how the service works, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html AWS Lambda: How it Works>
in the /AWS Lambda Developer Guide/.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-lambda)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Reference.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

> _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen` for more information.
