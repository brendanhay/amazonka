-- | The status of the firewall endpoint and firewall policy configuration
-- for a single VPC subnet.
--
-- For each VPC subnet that you associate with a firewall, Network Firewall
-- does the following:
--
-- -   Instantiates a firewall endpoint in the subnet, ready to take
--     traffic.
--
-- -   Configures the endpoint with the current firewall policy settings,
--     to provide the filtering behavior for the endpoint.
--
-- When you update a firewall, for example to add a subnet association or
-- change a rule group in the firewall policy, the affected sync states
-- reflect out-of-sync or not ready status until the changes are complete.
--
-- /See:/ 'newSyncState' smart constructor.
