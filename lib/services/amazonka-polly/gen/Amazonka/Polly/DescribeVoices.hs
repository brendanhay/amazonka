--
-- Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting
-- speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male
-- or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the
-- voice name.
--
-- When synthesizing speech ( @SynthesizeSpeech@ ), you provide the voice
-- ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by
-- @DescribeVoices@.
--
-- For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a
-- specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice.
-- Using the @DescribeVoices@ operation you can provide the user with a
-- list of available voices to select from.
--
-- You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available
-- voices. For example, if you specify @en-US@, the operation returns a
-- list of all available US English voices.
--
-- This operation requires permissions to perform the
-- @polly:DescribeVoices@ action.
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.
