-- Describes one or more of your route tables.

--
-- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. If a subnet is not explicitly associated with any route table, it is implicitly associated with the main route table. This command does not return the subnet ID for implicit associations.
--
-- For more information about route tables, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html Route Tables> in the /Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide/ .

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeRouteTables' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'drtsFilters' - One or more filters.     * @association.route-table-association-id@ - The ID of an association ID for the route table.     * @association.route-table-id@ - The ID of the route table involved in the association.     * @association.subnet-id@ - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.     * @association.main@ - Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the VPC (@true@ | @false@ ). Route tables that do not have an association ID are not returned in the response.     * @route-table-id@ - The ID of the route table.     * @route.destination-cidr-block@ - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a route in the table.     * @route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block@ - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in a route in the route table.     * @route.destination-prefix-list-id@ - The ID (prefix) of the AWS service specified in a route in the table.     * @route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id@ - The ID of an egress-only Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.     * @route.gateway-id@ - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.     * @route.instance-id@ - The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.     * @route.nat-gateway-id@ - The ID of a NAT gateway.     * @route.origin@ - Describes how the route was created. @CreateRouteTable@ indicates that the route was automatically created when the route table was created; @CreateRoute@ indicates that the route was manually added to the route table; @EnableVgwRoutePropagation@ indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.     * @route.state@ - The state of a route in the route table (@active@ | @blackhole@ ). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so on).     * @route.vpc-peering-connection-id@ - The ID of a VPC peering connection specified in a route in the table.     * @tag@ :/key/ =/value/ - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Specify the key of the tag in the filter name and the value of the tag in the filter value. For example, for the tag Purpose=X, specify @tag:Purpose@ for the filter name and @X@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the @tag-value@ filter. For example, if you use both the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the @tag@ :/key/ =/value/ filter.     * @tag-value@ - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the @tag-key@ filter.     * @vpc-id@ - The ID of the VPC for the route table.
--
-- * 'drtsDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'drtsRouteTableIds' - One or more route table IDs. Default: Describes all your route tables.
