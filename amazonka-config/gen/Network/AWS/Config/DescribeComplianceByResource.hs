--
-- Indicates whether the specified AWS resources are compliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this action returns the number of AWS Config rules that the resource does not comply with.
--
-- A resource is compliant if it complies with all the AWS Config rules that evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.
--
-- If AWS Config has no current evaluation results for the resource, it returns 'INSUFFICIENT_DATA'. This result might indicate one of the following conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:
--
-- -   AWS Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether it has, use the 'DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus' action to get the 'LastSuccessfulInvocationTime' and 'LastFailedInvocationTime'.
-- -   The rule\'s AWS Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to AWS Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your configuration recorder includes the 'config:PutEvaluations' permission. If the rule is a customer managed rule, verify that the AWS Lambda execution role includes the 'config:PutEvaluations' permission.
-- -   The rule\'s AWS Lambda function has returned 'NOT_APPLICABLE' for all evaluation results. This can occur if the resources were deleted or removed from the rule\'s scope.
