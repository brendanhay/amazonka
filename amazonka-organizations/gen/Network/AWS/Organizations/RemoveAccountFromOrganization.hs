--
-- Removes the specified account from the organization.
--
-- The removed account becomes a standalone account that isn\'t a member of
-- any organization. It\'s no longer subject to any policies and is
-- responsible for its own bill payments. The organization\'s management
-- account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member
-- account after it\'s removed from the organization.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account. Member accounts can remove themselves with LeaveOrganization
-- instead.
--
-- -   You can remove an account from your organization only if the account
--     is configured with the information required to operate as a
--     standalone account. When you create an account in an organization
--     using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the
--     information required of standalone accounts is /not/ automatically
--     collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must
--     choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact
--     information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the
--     payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS
--     activity that occurs while the account isn\'t attached to an
--     organization. To remove an account that doesn\'t yet have this
--     information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the
--     steps at
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided>
--     in the /AWS Organizations User Guide./
--
-- -   The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated
--     administrator account for any AWS service enabled for your
--     organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must
--     first change the delegated administrator account to another account
--     that is remaining in the organization.
--
-- -   After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were
--     attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. AWS
--     accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.
