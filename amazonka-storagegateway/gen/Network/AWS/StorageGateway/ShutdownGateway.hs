-- Shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.
--
--
-- The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.
--
-- After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except 'StartGateway' , 'DescribeGatewayInformation' , and 'ListGateways' . For more information, see 'ActivateGateway' . Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.
--
-- If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using 'DeleteGateway' ) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.
