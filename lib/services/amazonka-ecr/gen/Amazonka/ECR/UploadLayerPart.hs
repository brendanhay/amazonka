-- Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.
--
-- When an image is pushed, each new image layer is uploaded in parts. The
-- maximum size of each image layer part can be 20971520 bytes (or about
-- 20MB). The UploadLayerPart API is called once per each new image layer
-- part.
--
-- This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not generally used
-- by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should
-- use the @docker@ CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
