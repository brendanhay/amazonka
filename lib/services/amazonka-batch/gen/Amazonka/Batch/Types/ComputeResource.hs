    --
    -- [BEST_FIT (default)]
    --     Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs
    --     with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional
    --     instances of the selected instance type aren\'t available, Batch
    --     waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren\'t
    --     enough instances available or the user is reaching
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html Amazon EC2 service limits>,
    --     additional jobs aren\'t run until the currently running jobs are
    --     completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit
    --     scaling. If you\'re using Spot Fleets with @BEST_FIT@, the Spot
    --     Fleet IAM Role must be specified. Compute resources that use a
    --     @BEST_FIT@ allocation strategy don\'t support infrastructure updates
    --     and can\'t update some parameters. For more information, see
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html Updating compute environments>
    --     in the /Batch User Guide/.
    --
    -- [BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE]
    --     Batch selects additional instance types that are large enough to
    --     meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is
    --     for instance types with lower cost vCPUs. If additional instances of
    --     the previously selected instance types aren\'t available, Batch
    --     selects new instance types.
    --
    -- [SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED]
    --     Batch selects one or more instance types that are large enough to
    --     meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is
    --     for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This
    --     allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute
    --     resources.
    --
    -- With both @BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE@ and @SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED@
    -- strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the @BEST_FIT@
    -- strategy using Spot Instances, Batch might need to exceed @maxvCpus@ to
    -- meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds
    -- @maxvCpus@ by more than a single instance.

    -- Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never
    -- more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the

    instanceRole :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance
    -- families to launch any instance type within those families (for example,

--
-- [BEST_FIT (default)]
--     Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs
