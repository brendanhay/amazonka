-- Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one
-- operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite
-- alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite
-- alarms with one operation, but you can\'t delete two composite alarms
-- with one operation.
--
-- In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.
--
-- It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
-- composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B
-- also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can\'t delete
-- any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always
-- still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
-- delete.
--
-- To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the
-- rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency
-- that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is
-- to change the @AlarmRule@ of one of the alarms to @False@.
--
-- Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
-- detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
