  { -- | A brief description of the error.
    --
    -- -   __AccessDenied__: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes is
    --     failing to authenticate or authorize with your Kubernetes cluster
    --     API server.
    --
    -- -   __AsgInstanceLaunchFailures__: Your Auto Scaling group is
    --     experiencing failures while attempting to launch instances.
    --
    -- -   __AutoScalingGroupNotFound__: We couldn\'t find the Auto Scaling
    --     group associated with the managed node group. You may be able to
    --     recreate an Auto Scaling group with the same settings to recover.
    --
    -- -   __ClusterUnreachable__: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed
    --     nodes is unable to to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster API
    --     server. This can happen if there are network disruptions or if API
    --     servers are timing out processing requests.
    --
    -- -   __Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound__: We couldn\'t find the Amazon EC2
    --     launch template for your managed node group. You may be able to
    --     recreate a launch template with the same settings to recover.
    --
    -- -   __Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch__: The Amazon EC2 launch template
    --     version for your managed node group does not match the version that
    --     Amazon EKS created. You may be able to revert to the version that
    --     Amazon EKS created to recover.
    --
    -- -   __Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure__: We could not delete the remote
    --     access security group for your managed node group. Remove any
    --     dependencies from the security group.
    --
    -- -   __Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound__: We couldn\'t find the cluster security
    --     group for the cluster. You must recreate your cluster.
    --
    -- -   __Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration__: One or more Amazon EC2 subnets
    --     specified for a node group do not automatically assign public IP
    --     addresses to instances launched into it. If you want your instances
    --     to be assigned a public IP address, then you need to enable the
    --     @auto-assign public IP address@ setting for the subnet. See
    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip Modifying the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet>
    --     in the /Amazon VPC User Guide/.
    --
    -- -   __IamInstanceProfileNotFound__: We couldn\'t find the IAM instance
    --     profile for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate an
    --     instance profile with the same settings to recover.
    --
    -- -   __IamNodeRoleNotFound__: We couldn\'t find the IAM role for your
    --     managed node group. You may be able to recreate an IAM role with the
    --     same settings to recover.
    --
    -- -   __InstanceLimitExceeded__: Your Amazon Web Services account is
    --     unable to launch any more instances of the specified instance type.
    --     You may be able to request an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to
    --     recover.
    --
    -- -   __InsufficientFreeAddresses__: One or more of the subnets associated
    --     with your managed node group does not have enough available IP
    --     addresses for new nodes.
    --
    -- -   __InternalFailure__: These errors are usually caused by an Amazon
    --     EKS server-side issue.
    --
    -- -   __NodeCreationFailure__: Your launched instances are unable to
    --     register with your Amazon EKS cluster. Common causes of this failure
    --     are insufficient
