-- This implementation of the DELETE operation removes default encryption
-- from the bucket. For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption
-- feature, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html Amazon S3 Default Bucket Encryption>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
-- @s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration@ action. The bucket owner has this
-- permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to
-- others. For more information about permissions, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations>
