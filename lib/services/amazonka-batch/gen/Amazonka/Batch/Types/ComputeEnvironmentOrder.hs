-- the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for
-- job placement first. Compute environments must be in the @VALID@ state
-- before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute
-- environments must be either EC2 (@EC2@ or @SPOT@) or Fargate (@FARGATE@
-- or @FARGATE_SPOT@); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can\'t be
-- mixed.

-- All compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share
-- the same architecture. Batch doesn\'t support mixing compute environment
-- architecture types in a single job queue.
