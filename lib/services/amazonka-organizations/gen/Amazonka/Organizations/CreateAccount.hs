--
-- Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of
-- the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an
-- asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the
-- background. Because @CreateAccount@ operates asynchronously, it can
-- return a successful completion message even though account
-- initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few
-- minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the
-- status of the request, do one of the following:
--
-- -   Use the @Id@ value of the @CreateAccountStatus@ response element
--     from this operation to provide as a parameter to the
--     DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
--
-- -   Check the CloudTrail log for the @CreateAccountResult@ event. For
--     information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration Logging and monitoring in Organizations>
--     in the /Organizations User Guide./
--
-- The user who calls the API to create an account must have the
-- @organizations:CreateAccount@ permission. If you enabled all features in
-- the organization, Organizations creates the required service-linked role
-- named @AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations@. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs Organizations and Service-Linked Roles>
-- in the /Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
-- @organizations:TagResource@ permission.
--
-- Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named
-- @OrganizationAccountAccessRole@ by default) that grants users in the
-- management account administrator permissions in the new member account.
-- Principals in the management account can assume the role. Organizations
-- clones the company name and address information for the new account from
-- the organization\'s management account.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account.
--
-- For more information about creating accounts, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization>
-- in the /Organizations User Guide./
--
-- -   When you create an account in an organization using the
--     Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
--     required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as
--     a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA)
--     is /not/ automatically collected. If you must remove an account from
--     your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the
--     missing information. Follow the steps at
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info To leave an organization as a member account>
--     in the /Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- -   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
--     account limits for the organization, contact
--     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ Amazon Web Services Support>.
--
-- -   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
--     because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
--     then try again. If the error persists, contact
--     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ Amazon Web Services Support>.
--
-- -   Using @CreateAccount@ to create multiple temporary accounts isn\'t
--     recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost
--     Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For
--     information on the requirements and process for closing an account,
--     see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html Closing an Amazon Web Services account>
--     in the /Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
-- whether to create the account with the __IAM User and Role Access to
-- Billing Information__ switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
-- roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
-- the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
-- billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
-- for an account, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools>.
