    Amazon Simple Workflow Service

    The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build
    applications that use Amazon\'s cloud to coordinate work across
    distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a /task/ represents a logical
    unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow.
    Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask
    dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical
    flow of the application.

    Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and
    coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as
    tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

    This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of
    the Amazon SWF programming model, see the
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.SWF" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
