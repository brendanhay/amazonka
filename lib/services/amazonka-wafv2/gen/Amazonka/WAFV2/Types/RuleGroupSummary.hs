-- The following record fields are available, with the corresponding lenses provided

--
-- 'arn', 'ruleGroupSummary_arn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
--
-- 'description', 'ruleGroupSummary_description' - A description of the rule group that helps with identification.
--
-- 'id', 'ruleGroupSummary_id' - A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the
-- responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like
-- update and delete.
