-- This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions. For each user
-- session, you pass in an @entityID@ that represents the user. Evidently
-- then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation.
--
-- The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the
-- user\'s @entityID@ matches an override rule, the user is served the
-- variation specified by that rule.
--
-- Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to
-- a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage
-- of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in
-- the launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of
-- the various feature variations used for the launch.
--
-- If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing
-- experiment for this feature, the user might be assigned to a variation
-- in the experiment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users
-- that are allocated to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the
-- experiment, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of
-- the various feature variations used for the experiment.
--
-- If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served
-- the default variation.
