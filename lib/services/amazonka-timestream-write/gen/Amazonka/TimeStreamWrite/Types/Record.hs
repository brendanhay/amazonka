-- | Represents a time-series data point being written into Timestream. Each
-- record contains an array of dimensions. Dimensions represent the
-- metadata attributes of a time-series data point, such as the instance
-- name or Availability Zone of an EC2 instance. A record also contains the
-- measure name, which is the name of the measure being collected (for
-- example, the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance). Additionally, a record
-- contains the measure value and the value type, which is the data type of
-- the measure value. Also, the record contains the timestamp of when the
-- measure was collected and the timestamp unit, which represents the
-- granularity of the timestamp.
--
-- Records have a @Version@ field, which is a 64-bit @long@ that you can
-- use for updating data points. Writes of a duplicate record with the same
-- dimension, timestamp, and measure name but different measure value will
-- only succeed if the @Version@ attribute of the record in the write
-- request is higher than that of the existing record. Timestream defaults
-- to a @Version@ of @1@ for records without the @Version@ field.

-- 'dimensions', 'record_dimensions' - Contains the list of dimensions for time-series data points.

-- measures.
--
-- 'measureValue', 'record_measureValue' - Contains the measure value for the time-series data point.
--
-- 'measureValueType', 'record_measureValueType' - Contains the data type of the measure value for the time-series data
-- point. Default type is @DOUBLE@. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/writes.html#writes.data-types Data types>.
--
-- 'measureValues', 'record_measureValues' - Contains the list of MeasureValue for time-series data points.
--
-- This is only allowed for type @MULTI@. For scalar values, use

--
-- 'time', 'record_time' - Contains the time at which the measure value for the data point was

-- the epoch. For example, if the time value is @12345@ and the unit is
