-- Returns the Region the bucket resides in. You set the bucket\'s Region
-- using the @LocationConstraint@ request parameter in a @CreateBucket@
-- request. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html CreateBucket>.
--
-- To use this API operation against an access point, provide the alias of
-- the access point in place of the bucket name.
--
-- To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, provide
-- the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name.
-- If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the
-- error code @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@ is returned. For more
-- information about @InvalidAccessPointAliasError@, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList List of Error Codes>.
--
-- We recommend that you use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadBucket.html HeadBucket>
-- to return the Region that a bucket resides in. For backward
-- compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support GetBucketLocation.
--
-- The following operations are related to @GetBucketLocation@:
