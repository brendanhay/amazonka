## Description

Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service
for data archiving and online backup. Customers can reliably store large or
small amounts of data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a
significant savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low,
Amazon Glacier is optimized for infrequently accessed data where a retrieval
time of several hours is suitable.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-glacier)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html).
