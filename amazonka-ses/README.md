## Description

Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cost-effective outbound-only
email-sending service built on the reliable and scalable infrastructure that
Amazon.com has developed to serve its own customer base. With Amazon SES, you
can send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of
high-quality content and you only pay for what you use. Along with high
deliverability, Amazon SES provides easy, real-time access to your sending
statistics and built-in notifications for bounces, complaints, and deliveries
to help you fine-tune your email-sending strategy.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ses)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
