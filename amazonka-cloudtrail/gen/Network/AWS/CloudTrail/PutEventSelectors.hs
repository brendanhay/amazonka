-- Configures an event selector for your trail. Use event selectors to specify whether you want your trail to log management and/or data events. When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.
--
--
-- Example
--
--     * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
--
--     * The EC2 @GetConsoleOutput@ and @RunInstances@ API operations occur in your account.
--
--     * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
--
--     * The @RunInstances@ is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
--
--     * The @GetConsoleOutput@ is a read-only event but it doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.
--
--
--
-- The @PutEventSelectors@ operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an @InvalidHomeRegionException@ is thrown.
--
-- You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html Logging Data and Management Events for Trails > in the /AWS CloudTrail User Guide/ .
