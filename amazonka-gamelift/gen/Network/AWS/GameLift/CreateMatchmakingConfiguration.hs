-- Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A matchmaking configuration sets out guidelines for matching players and getting the matches into games. You can set up multiple matchmaking configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your game. Each matchmaking request ('StartMatchmaking' ) specifies a configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support the configuration being used.
--
--
-- To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.
--
-- __Player acceptance__ -- In each configuration, you have the option to require that all players accept participation in a proposed match. To enable this feature, set /AcceptanceRequired/ to true and specify a time limit for player acceptance. Players have the option to accept or reject a proposed match, and a match does not move ahead to game session placement unless all matched players accept.
--
-- __Matchmaking status notification__ -- There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket status with 'DescribeMatchmaking' ; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration (see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/match-notification.html Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking> ). Since notifications promise only "best effort" delivery, we recommend calling @DescribeMatchmaking@ if no notifications are received within 30 seconds.

-- | Creates a value of 'CreateMatchmakingConfiguration' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cmcGameProperties' - Set of developer-defined properties for a game session, formatted as a set of type:value pairs. These properties are included in the 'GameSession' object, which is passed to the game server with a request to start a new game session (see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match.
--
-- * 'cmcAcceptanceTimeoutSeconds' - Length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match. If any player rejects the match or fails to accept before the timeout, the ticket continues to look for an acceptable match.
--
-- * 'cmcNotificationTarget' - SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.
--
-- * 'cmcCustomEventData' - Information to attached to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.
--
-- * 'cmcGameSessionData' - Set of developer-defined game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is included in the 'GameSession' object, which is passed to the game server with a request to start a new game session (see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession Start a Game Session> ). This information is added to the new 'GameSession' object that is created for a successful match.
--
-- * 'cmcDescription' - Meaningful description of the matchmaking configuration.
--
-- * 'cmcAdditionalPlayerCount' - Number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match.
--
-- * 'cmcName' - Unique identifier for a matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
--
-- * 'cmcGameSessionQueueARNs' - Amazon Resource Name (<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html ARN> ) that is assigned to a game session queue and uniquely identifies it. Format is @arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912@ . These queues are used when placing game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Queues can be located in any region.
--
-- * 'cmcRequestTimeoutSeconds' - Maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that time out can be resubmitted as needed.
--
-- * 'cmcAcceptanceRequired' - Flag that determines whether or not a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to TRUE.
--
-- * 'cmcRuleSetName' - Unique identifier for a matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same region.
