--
-- Describes one or more of your instances.
--
--
-- If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns information for those instances. If you do not specify instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns information for all relevant instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the returned results.
--
-- Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.
--
-- If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

If you launch ten instances using the same launch request, you'll also get one reservation ID.     * @root-device-name@ - The name of the root device for the instance (for example, @/dev/sda1@ or @/dev/xvda@ ).     * @root-device-type@ - The type of root device that the instance uses (@ebs@ | @instance-store@ ).     * @source-dest-check@ - Indicates whether the instance performs source/destination checking.

Specify the key of the tag in the filter name and the value of the tag in the filter value. For example, for the tag Purpose=X, specify @tag:Purpose@ for the filter name and @X@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the @tag-value@ filter. For example, if you use both the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the @tag@ :/key/ =/value/ filter.     * @tag-value@ - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the @tag-key@ filter.     * @tenancy@ - The tenancy of an instance (@dedicated@ | @default@ | @host@ ).     * @virtualization-type@ - The virtualization type of the instance (@paravirtual@ | @hvm@ ).     * @vpc-id@ - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.
--
-- * 'diiNextToken' - The token to request the next page of results.
--
-- * 'diiInstanceIds' - One or more instance IDs. Default: Describes all your instances.
--
-- * 'diiDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'diiMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @NextToken@ value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter or tag filters in the same call.
