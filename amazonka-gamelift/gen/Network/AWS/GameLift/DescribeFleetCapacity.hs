-- Retrieves the current status of fleet capacity for one or more fleets. This information includes the number of instances that have been requested for the fleet and the number currently active. You can request capacity for all fleets, or specify a list of one or more fleet IDs. When requesting multiple fleets, use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. If successful, a 'FleetCapacity' object is returned for each requested fleet ID. When specifying a list of fleet IDs, attribute objects are returned only for fleets that currently exist.
