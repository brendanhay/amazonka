--
-- Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the
-- organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous
-- request that AWS performs in the background. Because @CreateAccount@
-- operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message
-- even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might
-- need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the
-- account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:
--
-- -   Use the @Id@ member of the @CreateAccountStatus@ response element
--     from this operation to provide as a parameter to the
--     DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.
--
-- -   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the @CreateAccountResult@ event.
--     For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization>
--     in the /AWS Organizations User Guide./
--
-- The user who calls the API to create an account must have the
-- @organizations:CreateAccount@ permission. If you enabled all features in
-- the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked
-- role named @AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations@. For more information, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles>
-- in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the
-- @organizations:TagResource@ permission.
--
-- AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role
-- (named @OrganizationAccountAccessRole@ by default) that grants users in
-- the management account administrator permissions in the new member
-- account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS
-- Organizations clones the company name and address information for the
-- new account from the organization\'s management account.
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account.
--
-- For more information about creating accounts, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization>
-- in the /AWS Organizations User Guide./
--
-- -   When you create an account in an organization using the AWS
--     Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
--     required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as
--     a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA)
--     is /not/ automatically collected. If you must remove an account from
--     your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the
--     missing information. Follow the steps at
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info To leave an organization as a member account>
--     in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- -   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your
--     account limits for the organization, contact
--     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ AWS Support>.
--
-- -   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed
--     because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and
--     then try again. If the error persists, contact
--     <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/ AWS Support>.
--
-- -   Using @CreateAccount@ to create multiple temporary accounts isn\'t
--     recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost
--     Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For
--     information on the requirements and process for closing an account,
--     see
--     <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html Closing an AWS Account>
--     in the /AWS Organizations User Guide/.
--
-- When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose
-- whether to create the account with the __IAM User and Role Access to
-- Billing Information__ switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and
-- roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for
-- the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access
-- billing information. For information about how to disable this switch
-- for an account, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/grantaccess.html Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools>.
