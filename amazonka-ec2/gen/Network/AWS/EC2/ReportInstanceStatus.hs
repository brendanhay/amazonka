-- Submits feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be in the @running@ state. If your experience with the instance differs from the instance status returned by 'DescribeInstanceStatus' , use 'ReportInstanceStatus' to report your experience with the instance. Amazon EC2 collects this information to improve the accuracy of status checks.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'risStartTime' - The time at which the reported instance health state began.

-- * 'risEndTime' - The time at which the reported instance health state ended.
--
-- * 'risDescription' - Descriptive text about the health state of your instance.
--
-- * 'risDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'risInstances' - One or more instances.

-- * 'risReasonCodes' - One or more reason codes that describes the health state of your instance.     * @instance-stuck-in-state@ : My instance is stuck in a state.     * @unresponsive@ : My instance is unresponsive.     * @not-accepting-credentials@ : My instance is not accepting my credentials.     * @password-not-available@ : A password is not available for my instance.     * @performance-network@ : My instance is experiencing performance problems which I believe are network related.     * @performance-instance-store@ : My instance is experiencing performance problems which I believe are related to the instance stores.     * @performance-ebs-volume@ : My instance is experiencing performance problems which I believe are related to an EBS volume.     * @performance-other@ : My instance is experiencing performance problems.     * @other@ : [explain using the description parameter]
