--
-- The @BatchWriteItem@ operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or
-- more tables. A single call to @BatchWriteItem@ can write up to 16 MB of
-- data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests.
-- Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.
--
-- @BatchWriteItem@ cannot update items. To update items, use the
-- @UpdateItem@ action.
--
-- The individual @PutItem@ and @DeleteItem@ operations specified in
-- @BatchWriteItem@ are atomic; however @BatchWriteItem@ as a whole is not.
-- If any requested operations fail because the table\'s provisioned
-- throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the
-- failed operations are returned in the @UnprocessedItems@ response
-- parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests.
-- Typically, you would call @BatchWriteItem@ in a loop. Each iteration
-- would check for unprocessed items and submit a new @BatchWriteItem@
-- request with those unprocessed items until all items have been
-- processed.
--
-- If /none/ of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned
-- throughput on all of the tables in the request, then @BatchWriteItem@
-- returns a @ProvisionedThroughputExceededException@.
--
-- If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch
-- operation on those items. However, /we strongly recommend that you use
-- an exponential backoff algorithm/. If you retry the batch operation
-- immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to
-- throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation
-- using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much
-- more likely to succeed.
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations Batch Operations and Error Handling>
-- in the /Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide/.
--
-- With @BatchWriteItem@, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts
-- of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database
-- into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale
-- operations, @BatchWriteItem@ does not behave in the same way as
-- individual @PutItem@ and @DeleteItem@ calls would. For example, you
-- cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and
-- @BatchWriteItem@ does not return deleted items in the response.
--
-- If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use
-- threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the
-- necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don\'t
-- support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at
-- a time. In both situations, @BatchWriteItem@ performs the specified put
-- and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread
-- pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your
-- application.
--
-- Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete
-- request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is
-- processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items
-- consume one write capacity unit.
--
-- If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire
-- batch write operation:
--
-- -   One or more tables specified in the @BatchWriteItem@ request does
--     not exist.
--
-- -   Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not
--     match those in the corresponding table\'s primary key schema.
--
-- -   You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same
--     @BatchWriteItem@ request. For example, you cannot put and delete the
--     same item in the same @BatchWriteItem@ request.
--
-- -   Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and
--     range keys (which essentially is two put operations).
--
-- -   There are more than 25 requests in the batch.
--
-- -   Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.
--
-- -   The total request size exceeds 16 MB.
