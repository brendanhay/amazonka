--
-- 'startedAt', 'jobExecution_startedAt' - The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution started.

-- execution.
--
-- 'queuedAt', 'jobExecution_queuedAt' - The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execution was queued.
--
-- 'forceCanceled', 'jobExecution_forceCanceled' - Will be @true@ if the job execution was canceled with the optional

-- 'versionNumber', 'jobExecution_versionNumber' - The version of the job execution. Job execution versions are incremented
-- each time they are updated by a device.
--
-- 'executionNumber', 'jobExecution_executionNumber' - A string (consisting of the digits \"0\" through \"9\") which identifies
-- this particular job execution on this particular device. It can be used
-- in commands which return or update job execution information.
--
-- 'approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut', 'jobExecution_approximateSecondsBeforeTimedOut' - The estimated number of seconds that remain before the job execution
-- status will be changed to @TIMED_OUT@. The timeout interval can be
-- anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The actual
