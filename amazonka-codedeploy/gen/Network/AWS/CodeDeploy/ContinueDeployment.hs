-- For a blue\/green deployment, starts the process of rerouting traffic
-- from instances in the original environment to instances in the
-- replacement environment without waiting for a specified wait time to
-- elapse. (Traffic rerouting, which is achieved by registering instances
-- in the replacement environment with the load balancer, can start as soon
-- as all instances have a status of Ready.)
