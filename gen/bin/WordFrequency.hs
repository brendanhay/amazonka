-- | A word frequency table ranked according to Zipf\'s law.

-- SO: The best way to proceed is to model the distribution of the output.
-- A good first approximation is to assume all words are independently
-- distributed. Then you only need to know the relative frequency of all
-- words. It is reasonable to assume that they follow Zipf's law, that is
-- the word with rank n in the list of words has probability roughly @1\/(n
-- log N)@ where @N@ is the number of words in the dictionary.
