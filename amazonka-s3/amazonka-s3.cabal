description:
    Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3 has
    a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve
    any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any
    developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,
    inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own
    global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of
    scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.S3" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
