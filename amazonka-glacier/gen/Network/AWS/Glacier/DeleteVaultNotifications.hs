-- This operation deletes the notification configuration set for a vault.
-- The operation is eventually consistent; that is, it might take some time
-- for Amazon S3 Glacier to completely disable the notifications and you
-- might still receive some notifications for a short time after you send
-- the delete request.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
