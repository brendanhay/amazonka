-- Creates or updates a subscription filter and associates it with the
-- specified log group. Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a
-- real-time stream of log events ingested through
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html PutLogEvents>
-- and have them delivered to a specific destination. When log events are
-- sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed
-- with the gzip format.
--
-- The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:
--
-- -   An Amazon Kinesis stream belonging to the same account as the
--     subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
--
-- -   A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for
--     cross-account delivery.
--
-- -   An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same
--     account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
--
-- -   An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the
--     subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
--
-- There can only be one subscription filter associated with a log group.
-- If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct
-- name in @filterName@. Otherwise, the call fails because you cannot
-- associate a second filter with a log group.
--
-- To perform a @PutSubscriptionFilter@ operation, you must also have the
-- @iam:PassRole@ permission.
