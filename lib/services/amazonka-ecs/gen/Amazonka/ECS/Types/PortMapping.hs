-- | Port mappings allow containers to access ports on the host container
-- instance to send or receive traffic. Port mappings are specified as part
-- of the container definition.
--
-- If you use containers in a task with the @awsvpc@ or @host@ network
-- mode, specify the exposed ports using @containerPort@. The @hostPort@
-- can be left blank or it must be the same value as the @containerPort@.
--
-- Most fields of this parameter (@containerPort@, @hostPort@, @protocol@)
-- maps to @PortBindings@ in the
-- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate Create a container>
-- section of the
-- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/ Docker Remote API> and the
-- @--publish@ option to
-- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/ docker run> .
-- If the network mode of a task definition is set to @host@, host ports
-- must either be undefined or match the container port in the port
-- mapping.
--
-- You can\'t expose the same container port for multiple protocols. If you
-- attempt this, an error is returned.
--
-- After a task reaches the @RUNNING@ status, manual and automatic host and
-- container port assignments are visible in the @networkBindings@ section
-- of DescribeTasks API responses.

    --
    --     -   For containers in a task with the @bridge@ network mode, the
    --         Amazon ECS agent finds open host ports from the default
