-- | A workgroup, which contains a name, description, creation time, state,
-- and other configuration, listed under WorkGroup$Configuration. Each
-- workgroup enables you to isolate queries for you or your group of users
-- from other queries in the same account, to configure the query results
-- location and the encryption configuration (known as workgroup settings),
-- to enable sending query metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, and to establish
-- per-query data usage control limits for all queries in a workgroup. The
-- workgroup settings override is specified in
-- EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration (true\/false) in the
-- WorkGroupConfiguration. See
-- WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.
