-- Deletes a build. This action permanently deletes the build record and any uploaded build files.
--
--
-- To delete a build, specify its ID. Deleting a build does not affect the status of any active fleets using the build, but you can no longer create new fleets with the deleted build.
--
-- Build-related operations include:
--
--     * 'CreateBuild'
--
--     * 'ListBuilds'
--
--     * 'DescribeBuild'
--
--     * 'UpdateBuild'
--
