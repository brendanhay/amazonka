-- Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.
--
-- Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2
-- instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives
-- you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still
-- get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating Capacity
-- Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2
-- capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html Capacity Reservations>
-- in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/.
--
-- Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2
-- does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. If your
-- request fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again
-- at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a
-- smaller capacity reservation. If your application is flexible across
-- instance types and sizes, try to create a Capacity Reservation with
-- different instance attributes.
--
-- Your request could also fail if the requested quantity exceeds your
-- On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance type. If your request
-- fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit
-- for the required instance type and try again. For more information about
-- increasing your instance limits, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html Amazon EC2 Service Quotas>
