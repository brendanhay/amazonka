## Description

ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale
an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web
applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed,
in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.
Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing
the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides a
resilient system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow
website and application load times. Through integration with Amazon
CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key
performance metrics associated with your Memcached or Redis nodes.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticache)
and [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
