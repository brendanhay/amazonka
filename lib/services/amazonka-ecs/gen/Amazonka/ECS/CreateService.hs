-- Runs and maintains your desired number of tasks from a specified task
-- definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the
-- @desiredCount@, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the
-- specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService
-- action.
--
-- Starting April 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services will not onboard new
-- customers to Amazon Elastic Inference (EI), and will help current
-- customers migrate their workloads to options that offer better price and
-- performance. After April 15, 2023, new customers will not be able to
-- launch instances with Amazon EI accelerators in Amazon SageMaker, Amazon
-- ECS, or Amazon EC2. However, customers who have used Amazon EI at least
-- once during the past 30-day period are considered current customers and
-- will be able to continue using the service.
--
-- In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service,
-- you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers.
-- The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are
-- associated with the service. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html Service load balancing>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- Tasks for services that don\'t use a load balancer are considered
-- healthy if they\'re in the @RUNNING@ state. Tasks for services that use
-- a load balancer are considered healthy if they\'re in the @RUNNING@
-- state and are reported as healthy by the load balancer.
--
-- There are two service scheduler strategies available:
--
-- -   @REPLICA@ - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains
--     your desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the
--     service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can
--     use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task
--     placement decisions. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html Service scheduler concepts>
--     in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- -   @DAEMON@ - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task
--     on each active container instance that meets all of the task
--     placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service
--     scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running
--     tasks. It also stops tasks that don\'t meet the placement
--     constraints. When using this strategy, you don\'t need to specify a
--     desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service
--     Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html Service scheduler concepts>
--     in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service.
-- The deployment is initiated by changing properties. For example, the
-- deployment might be initiated by the task definition or by your desired
-- count of a service. This is done with an UpdateService operation. The
-- default value for a replica service for @minimumHealthyPercent@ is 100%.
-- The default value for a daemon service for @minimumHealthyPercent@ is
-- 0%.
--
-- If a service uses the @ECS@ deployment controller, the minimum healthy
-- percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service
-- that must remain in the @RUNNING@ state during a deployment.
-- Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of your desired number of
-- tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer). This happens when any of your
-- container instances are in the @DRAINING@ state if the service contains
-- tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this parameter, you can deploy
-- without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if you set your
-- service to have desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy
-- percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up
-- cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. If they\'re in the
-- @RUNNING@ state, tasks for services that don\'t use a load balancer are
-- considered healthy . If they\'re in the @RUNNING@ state and reported as
-- healthy by the load balancer, tasks for services that /do/ use a load
-- balancer are considered healthy . The default value for minimum healthy
-- percent is 100%.
--
-- If a service uses the @ECS@ deployment controller, the __maximum
-- percent__ parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in
-- a service that are allowed in the @RUNNING@ or @PENDING@ state during a
-- deployment. Specifically, it represents it as a percentage of the
-- desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer). This
-- happens when any of your container instances are in the @DRAINING@ state
-- if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. Using this
-- parameter, you can define the deployment batch size. For example, if
-- your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent
-- value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping
-- the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do
-- this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.
--
-- If a service uses either the @CODE_DEPLOY@ or @EXTERNAL@ deployment
-- controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the __minimum
-- healthy percent__ and __maximum percent__ values are used only to define
-- the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that
-- remain in the @RUNNING@ state. This is while the container instances are
-- in the @DRAINING@ state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate
-- launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values
-- aren\'t used. This is the case even if they\'re currently visible when
-- describing your service.
--
-- When creating a service that uses the @EXTERNAL@ deployment controller,
-- you can specify only parameters that aren\'t controlled at the task set
-- level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your
-- services using the CreateTaskSet operation. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html Amazon ECS deployment types>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
-- placement. For information about task placement and task placement
-- strategies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html Amazon ECS task placement>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.

    --
    -- If the service uses the rolling update (@ECS@) deployment controller and
    -- using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you

    --
    -- If the service uses the @CODE_DEPLOY@ deployment controller, the service
    -- is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
    -- Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two
    -- target groups (referred to as a @targetGroupPair@). During a deployment,
    -- CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status
    -- @PRIMARY@, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also
    -- associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The
    -- load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for
    -- production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform
    -- validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic
    -- to it.
    --
    -- If you use the @CODE_DEPLOY@ deployment controller, these values can be

    -- registered as a target in the target group that\'s specified here.
    --
    -- For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
    -- name, the container name , and the container port to access from the

    -- those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
    -- Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren\'t
    -- supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services,
    -- you must choose @ip@ as the target type, not @instance@. This is because
    -- tasks that use the @awsvpc@ network mode are associated with an elastic
    -- network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
    loadBalancers :: Prelude.Maybe [LoadBalancer],
    -- | The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required
    -- for task definitions that use the @awsvpc@ network mode to receive their

    placementConstraints :: Prelude.Maybe [PlacementConstraint],
    -- | The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
    -- specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.
    placementStrategy :: Prelude.Maybe [PlacementStrategy],
    -- | The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A

    propagateTags :: Prelude.Maybe PropagateTags,
    -- | The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows
    -- Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This
    -- parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your
    -- service and your task definition doesn\'t use the @awsvpc@ network mode.
    -- If you specify the @role@ parameter, you must also specify a load
    -- balancer object with the @loadBalancers@ parameter.
    --
    -- If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role,
    -- that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The

    -- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html Services>.
    --
    -- There are two service scheduler strategies available:
    --
    -- -   @REPLICA@-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
    --     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
    --     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
    --     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
    --     decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses
    --     the @CODE_DEPLOY@ or @EXTERNAL@ deployment controller types.
    --
    -- -   @DAEMON@-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
    --     each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
    --     constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
    --     also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
    --     will stop tasks that don\'t meet the placement constraints. When
    --     you\'re using this strategy, you don\'t need to specify a desired
    --     number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto
    --     Scaling policies.
    --
    --     Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the @CODE_DEPLOY@ or
    --     @EXTERNAL@ deployment controller types don\'t support the @DAEMON@
    --     scheduling strategy.
    schedulingStrategy :: Prelude.Maybe SchedulingStrategy,
    -- | The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services,

    serviceRegistries :: Prelude.Maybe [ServiceRegistry],
    -- | The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
    -- organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
    -- which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as

    --
    -- The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
    --
    -- -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
    --
    -- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can

    --
    -- -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    --
    -- -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
    --
    -- -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
    --     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
    --     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
    --     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following

    --
    -- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.

    -- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
    --     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
    --     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or

-- task has first started. This is only used when your service is
-- configured to use a load balancer. If your service has a load balancer
-- defined and you don\'t specify a health check grace period value, the
-- default value of @0@ is used.
--
-- If you do not use an Elastic Load Balancing, we recommend that you use
-- the @startPeriod@ in the task definition health check parameters. For
-- more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html Health check>.
--
-- If your service\'s tasks take a while to start and respond to Elastic
-- Load Balancing health checks, you can specify a health check grace
-- period of up to 2,147,483,647 seconds (about 69 years). During that
-- time, the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores health check status. This
-- grace period can prevent the service scheduler from marking tasks as
-- unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
--
-- 'launchType', 'createService_launchType' - The infrastructure that you run your service on. For more information,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html Amazon ECS launch types>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- The @FARGATE@ launch type runs your tasks on Fargate On-Demand
-- infrastructure.
--
-- Fargate Spot infrastructure is available for use but a capacity provider
-- strategy must be used. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/fargate-capacity-providers.html Fargate capacity providers>
-- in the /Amazon ECS User Guide for Fargate/.
--
-- The @EC2@ launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered
-- to your cluster.
--
-- The @EXTERNAL@ launch type runs your tasks on your on-premises server or
-- virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster.
--
-- A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy.
-- If a @launchType@ is specified, the @capacityProviderStrategy@ parameter
-- must be omitted.
--
-- 'loadBalancers', 'createService_loadBalancers' - A load balancer object representing the load balancers to use with your
-- service. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html Service load balancing>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- If the service uses the rolling update (@ECS@) deployment controller and
-- using either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you
-- must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to the service. The
-- service-linked role is required for services that use multiple target
-- groups. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- If the service uses the @CODE_DEPLOY@ deployment controller, the service
-- is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load
-- Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two
-- target groups (referred to as a @targetGroupPair@). During a deployment,
-- CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status
-- @PRIMARY@, and it associates one target group with it. Then, it also
-- associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The
-- load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for
-- production traffic and an optional listener that you can use to perform
-- validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic
-- to it.
--
-- If you use the @CODE_DEPLOY@ deployment controller, these values can be
-- changed when updating the service.
--
-- For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object
-- must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name, and
-- the container port to access from the load balancer. The container name
-- must be as it appears in a container definition. The load balancer name
-- parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a
-- container instance, the container instance and port combination is
-- registered as a target in the target group that\'s specified here.
--
-- For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer
-- name, the container name , and the container port to access from the
-- load balancer. The container name must be as it appears in a container
-- definition. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task
-- from this service is placed on a container instance, the container
-- instance is registered with the load balancer that\'s specified here.
--
-- Services with tasks that use the @awsvpc@ network mode (for example,
-- those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load
-- Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers aren\'t
-- supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services,
-- you must choose @ip@ as the target type, not @instance@. This is because
-- tasks that use the @awsvpc@ network mode are associated with an elastic
-- network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.
--
-- 'networkConfiguration', 'createService_networkConfiguration' - The network configuration for the service. This parameter is required
-- for task definitions that use the @awsvpc@ network mode to receive their
-- own elastic network interface, and it isn\'t supported for other network
-- modes. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html Task networking>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- 'placementConstraints', 'createService_placementConstraints' - An array of placement constraint objects to use for tasks in your
-- service. You can specify a maximum of 10 constraints for each task. This
-- limit includes constraints in the task definition and those specified at
-- runtime.
--
-- 'placementStrategy', 'createService_placementStrategy' - The placement strategy objects to use for tasks in your service. You can
-- specify a maximum of 5 strategy rules for each service.
--
-- 'platformVersion', 'createService_platformVersion' - The platform version that your tasks in the service are running on. A
-- platform version is specified only for tasks using the Fargate launch
-- type. If one isn\'t specified, the @LATEST@ platform version is used.
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html Fargate platform versions>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- 'propagateTags', 'createService_propagateTags' - Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task definition to the
-- task. If no value is specified, the tags aren\'t propagated. Tags can
-- only be propagated to the task during task creation. To add tags to a
-- task after task creation, use the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html TagResource>
-- API action.
--
-- The default is @NONE@.
--
-- 'role'', 'createService_role' - The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows
-- Amazon ECS to make calls to your load balancer on your behalf. This
-- parameter is only permitted if you are using a load balancer with your
-- service and your task definition doesn\'t use the @awsvpc@ network mode.
-- If you specify the @role@ parameter, you must also specify a load
-- balancer object with the @loadBalancers@ parameter.
--
-- If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role,
-- that role is used for your service unless you specify a role here. The
-- service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the
-- @awsvpc@ network mode or if the service is configured to use service
-- discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or
-- Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you don\'t specify a role
-- here. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- If your specified role has a path other than @\/@, then you must either
-- specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name
-- with the path. For example, if a role with the name @bar@ has a path of
-- @\/foo\/@ then you would specify @\/foo\/bar@ as the role name. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-friendly-names Friendly names and paths>
-- in the /IAM User Guide/.
--
-- 'schedulingStrategy', 'createService_schedulingStrategy' - The scheduling strategy to use for the service. For more information,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html Services>.
--
-- There are two service scheduler strategies available:
--
-- -   @REPLICA@-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
--     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
--     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
--     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
--     decisions. This scheduler strategy is required if the service uses
--     the @CODE_DEPLOY@ or @EXTERNAL@ deployment controller types.
--
-- -   @DAEMON@-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
--     each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
--     constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
--     also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
--     will stop tasks that don\'t meet the placement constraints. When
--     you\'re using this strategy, you don\'t need to specify a desired
--     number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto
--     Scaling policies.
--
--     Tasks using the Fargate launch type or the @CODE_DEPLOY@ or
--     @EXTERNAL@ deployment controller types don\'t support the @DAEMON@
--     scheduling strategy.
--
-- 'serviceConnectConfiguration', 'createService_serviceConnectConfiguration' - The configuration for this service to discover and connect to services,
-- and be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a
-- namespace.
--
-- Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to services
-- in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of the
-- clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
-- container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
-- the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
-- Connect. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html Service Connect>
-- in the /Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- 'serviceRegistries', 'createService_serviceRegistries' - The details of the service discovery registry to associate with this
-- service. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html Service discovery>.
--
-- Each service may be associated with one service registry. Multiple
-- service registries for each service isn\'t supported.
--
-- 'tags', 'createService_tags' - The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
-- organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
-- which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as
-- well.
--
-- The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
--
-- -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
--
-- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
--     have only one value.
--
-- -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
--     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
--     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
--     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
--     characters: + - = . _ : \/ \@.
--
-- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
--
-- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
--     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
--     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
--     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
--     your tags per resource limit.
--
-- 'taskDefinition', 'createService_taskDefinition' - The @family@ and @revision@ (@family:revision@) or full ARN of the task
-- definition to run in your service. If a @revision@ isn\'t specified, the
-- latest @ACTIVE@ revision is used.
--
-- A task definition must be specified if the service uses either the @ECS@
-- or @CODE_DEPLOY@ deployment controllers.
--
-- For more information about deployment types, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html Amazon ECS deployment types>.
--
-- 'serviceName', 'createService_serviceName' - The name of your service. Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase),
-- numbers, underscores, and hyphens are allowed. Service names must be
-- unique within a cluster, but you can have similarly named services in
-- multiple clusters within a Region or across multiple Regions.

-- which you define. When a service is deleted, the tags are deleted as
-- well.
--
-- The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
--
-- -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
--
-- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
--     have only one value.
--
-- -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
--     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
--     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
--     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
--     characters: + - = . _ : \/ \@.
--
-- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
--
-- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
--     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
--     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
--     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
--     your tags per resource limit.
