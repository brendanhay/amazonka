-- The @DeleteWorkerBlock@ operation allows you to reinstate a blocked
-- Worker to work on your HITs. This operation reverses the effects of the
-- CreateWorkerBlock operation. You need the Worker ID to use this
-- operation. If the Worker ID is missing or invalid, this operation fails
-- and returns the message “WorkerId is invalid.” If the specified Worker
-- is not blocked, this operation returns successfully.
