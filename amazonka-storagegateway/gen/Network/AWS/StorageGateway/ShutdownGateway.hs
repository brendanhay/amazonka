--
-- This operation shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut
-- down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of
-- your request.
--
-- The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the
-- storage gateway\'s virtual machine (VM) and not the VM.
--
-- If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut
-- down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.
--
-- After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except
-- StartGateway, DescribeGatewayInformation, and ListGateways. For more
-- information, see ActivateGateway. Your applications cannot read from or
-- write to the gateway\'s storage volumes, and there are no snapshots
-- taken.
--
-- When you make a shutdown request, you will get a @200 OK@ success
-- response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway
-- to shut down. You can call the DescribeGatewayInformation API to check
-- the status. For more information, see ActivateGateway.
--
-- If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway
-- (using DeleteGateway) to no longer pay software charges associated with
-- the gateway.
