-- Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
-- specified user. Some AWS services use X.509 signing certificates to
-- validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When
-- you upload the certificate, its default status is 'Active'.
--
-- If the 'UserName' field is not specified, the user name is determined
-- implicitly based on the AWS access key ID used to sign the request.
-- Because this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can
-- use this action to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has
-- no associated users.
--
-- Because the body of a X.509 certificate can be large, you should use
-- POST rather than GET when calling 'UploadSigningCertificate'. For
-- information about setting up signatures and authorization through the
-- API, go to
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html Signing AWS API Requests>
-- in the /AWS General Reference/. For general information about using the
-- Query API with IAM, go to
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html Making Query Requests>
-- in the /Using IAM/guide.
