-- Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password
-- that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These
-- credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified
-- service.
--
-- You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for
-- each supported service per user.
--
-- You can create service-specific credentials for CodeCommit and Amazon
-- Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra).
--
-- You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling
-- ResetServiceSpecificCredential.
--
-- For more information about service-specific credentials, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html Using IAM with CodeCommit: Git credentials, SSH keys, and Amazon Web Services access keys>
