-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeActivities' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'daStartTime' - The timestamp that determines the starting time of the activities; the response includes the activities performed after the specified timestamp.
--
-- * 'daAuthenticationToken' - Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. This field should not be set when using administrative API actions, as in accessing the API using AWS credentials.
--
-- * 'daUserId' - The ID of the user who performed the action. The response includes activities pertaining to this user. This is an optional parameter and is only applicable for administrative API (SigV4) requests.
--
-- * 'daMarker' - The marker for the next set of results. (You received this marker from a previous call.)
--
-- * 'daEndTime' - The timestamp that determines the end time of the activities; the response includes the activities performed before the specified timestamp.
--
-- * 'daLimit' - The maximum number of items to return.
--
-- * 'daOrganizationId' - The ID of the organization. This is a mandatory parameter when using administrative API (SigV4) requests.
