-- Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. In
-- order to send email using the @SendEmail@ operation, your message must
-- meet the following requirements:
--
-- -   The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If
--     you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain,
--     the operation will result in an \"Email address not verified\"
--     error.
--
-- -   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only
--     send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses
--     associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more
--     information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html Verifying Email Addresses and Domains>
--     in the /Amazon SES Developer Guide./
--
-- -   The maximum message size is 10 MB.
--
-- -   The message must include at least one recipient email address. The
--     recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:
--     address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not
--     in the format /UserName\@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain/), the
--     entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other
--     recipients that are valid.
--
-- -   The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
--     CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a
--     larger audience, you can divide your recipient list into groups of
--     50 or fewer, and then call the @SendEmail@ operation several times
--     to send the message to each group.
--
-- For every message that you send, the total number of recipients
-- (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
-- against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
-- (your /sending quota/). For more information about sending quotas in
-- Amazon SES, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-limits.html Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits>
