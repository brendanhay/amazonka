-- | Creates a value of 'ListCreateAccountStatus' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lcasStates' - A list of one or more states that you want included in the response. If this parameter is not present, then all requests are included in the response.
--
-- * 'lcasNextToken' - Use this parameter if you receive a @NextToken@ response in a previous request that indicates that there is more output available. Set it to the value of the previous call's @NextToken@ response to indicate where the output should continue from.
--
-- * 'lcasMaxResults' - (Optional) Use this to limit the number of results you want included in the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the @NextToken@ response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the @NextToken@ request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check @NextToken@ after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results.
