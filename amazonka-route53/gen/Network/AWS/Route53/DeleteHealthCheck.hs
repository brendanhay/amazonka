-- This action deletes a health check. To delete a health check, send a
-- @DELETE@ request to the @2013-04-01\/healthcheck\/health check ID@
-- resource.
--
-- You can delete a health check only if there are no resource record sets
-- associated with this health check. If resource record sets are
-- associated with this health check, you must disassociate them before you
-- can delete your health check. If you try to delete a health check that
-- is associated with resource record sets, Route 53 will deny your request
-- with a @HealthCheckInUse@ error. For information about disassociating
-- the records from your health check, see ChangeResourceRecordSets.
