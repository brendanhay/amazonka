-- Deletes everything related to a fleet. Before deleting a fleet, you must
-- set the fleet\'s desired capacity to zero. See UpdateFleetCapacity.
--
-- If the fleet being deleted has a VPC peering connection, you first need
-- to get a valid authorization (good for 24 hours) by calling
-- CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization. You do not need to explicitly delete the
-- VPC peering connection--this is done as part of the delete fleet
-- process.
--
-- This operation removes the fleet and its resources. Once a fleet is
-- deleted, you can no longer use any of the resource in that fleet.
