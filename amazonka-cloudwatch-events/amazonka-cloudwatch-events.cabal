description:
    Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your
    AWS resources. When your resources change state they automatically send
    events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected
    events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can
    also use rules to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example,
    you can configure rules to:

    -   Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries
        when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the
        running state.
    -   Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis
        stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability
        risks.
    -   Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an
        Amazon EBS volume.

    For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.CloudWatchEvents" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>
    to get started.
