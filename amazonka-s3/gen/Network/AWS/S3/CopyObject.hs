--
-- Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.
--
-- You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create
-- a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic operation
-- using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must
-- use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information,
-- see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API>.
--
-- All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have
-- /read/ access to the source object and /write/ access to the destination
-- bucket. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html REST Authentication>.
-- Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region
-- that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.
--
-- A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy
-- request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs
-- before the copy operation starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3
-- error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response
-- is embedded in the @200 OK@ response. This means that a @200 OK@
-- response can contain either a success or an error. Design your
-- application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
-- appropriately.
--
-- If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
-- the copied object.
--
-- If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If
-- it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need
-- to read the entire body.
--
-- The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that
-- you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see
-- <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/ Amazon S3 pricing>.
--
-- Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If
-- you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint,
-- you get a 400 @Bad Request@ error. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html Transfer Acceleration>.
--
-- __Metadata__
--
-- When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or
-- specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to
-- private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL
-- setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html Using ACLs>.
--
-- To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source
-- object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can
-- optionally add the @x-amz-metadata-directive@ header. When you grant
-- permissions, you can use the @s3:x-amz-metadata-directive@ condition key
-- to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more
-- information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html Specifying Conditions in a Policy>
-- in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/. For a complete list of Amazon
-- S3-specific condition keys, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3>.
--
-- __@x-amz-copy-source-if@ Headers__
--
-- To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the
-- @Etag@ matches or whether the object was modified before or after a
-- specified date, use the following request parameters:
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@
--
-- If both the @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ and
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ headers are present in the
-- request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns @200 OK@ and copies
-- the data:
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-match@ condition evaluates to true
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since@ condition evaluates to false
--
-- If both the @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ and
-- @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ headers are present in the request
-- and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the @412 Precondition Failed@
-- response code:
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match@ condition evaluates to false
--
-- -   @x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since@ condition evaluates to true
--
-- All headers with the @x-amz-@ prefix, including @x-amz-copy-source@,
-- must be signed.
--
-- __Server-side encryption__
--
-- When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the
-- appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using
-- server-side encryption with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or
-- SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side
-- encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its
-- data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more
-- information about server-side encryption, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html Using Server-Side Encryption>.
--
-- If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the
-- object. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html Amazon S3 Bucket Keys>
-- in the /Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers__
--
-- When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant
-- ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the
-- owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant
-- permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
-- by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html Access Control List (ACL) Overview>
-- and
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html Managing ACLs Using the REST API>.
--
-- __Storage Class Options__
--
-- You can use the @CopyObject@ operation to change the storage class of an
-- object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the @StorageClass@
-- parameter. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html Storage Classes>
-- in the /Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide/.
--
-- __Versioning__
--
-- By default, @x-amz-copy-source@ identifies the current version of an
-- object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3
-- behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use
-- the @versionId@ subresource.
--
-- If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a
-- unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is
-- different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns
-- the version ID of the copied object in the @x-amz-version-id@ response
-- header in the response.
--
-- If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the
-- version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.
--
-- If the source object\'s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a
-- copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the
-- copy operation. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html RestoreObject>.
--
-- The following operations are related to @CopyObject@:
--
-- -   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html PutObject>
--
-- -   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html GetObject>
--
-- For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html Copying Objects>.

    --
    -- -   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name

    --     from the bucket @awsexamplebucket@, use
    --     @awsexamplebucket\/reports\/january.pdf@. The value must be URL
    --     encoded.

    --     point, in the format
    --     @arn:aws:s3:\<Region>:\<account-id>:accesspoint\/\<access-point-name>\/object\/\<key>@.
