-- | Describes a request to enable or modify the automatic snapshot add-on
-- for an Amazon Lightsail instance or disk.
--
-- When you modify the automatic snapshot time for a resource, it is
-- typically effective immediately except under the following conditions:
--
-- -   If an automatic snapshot has been created for the current day, and
--     you change the snapshot time to a later time of day, then the new
--     snapshot time will be effective the following day. This ensures that
--     two snapshots are not created for the current day.
--
-- -   If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current
--     day, and you change the snapshot time to an earlier time of day,
--     then the new snapshot time will be effective the following day and a
--     snapshot is automatically created at the previously set time for the
--     current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current
--     day.
--
-- -   If an automatic snapshot has not yet been created for the current
--     day, and you change the snapshot time to a time that is within 30
--     minutes from your current time, then the new snapshot time will be
--     effective the following day and a snapshot is automatically created
--     at the previously set time for the current day. This ensures that a
--     snapshot is created for the current day, because 30 minutes is
--     required between your current time and the new snapshot time that
--     you specify.
--
-- -   If an automatic snapshot is scheduled to be created within 30
--     minutes from your current time and you change the snapshot time,
--     then the new snapshot time will be effective the following day and a
--     snapshot is automatically created at the previously set time for the
--     current day. This ensures that a snapshot is created for the current
--     day, because 30 minutes is required between your current time and
--     the new snapshot time that you specify.
