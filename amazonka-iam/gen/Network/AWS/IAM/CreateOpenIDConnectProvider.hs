--
-- Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that
-- supports <http://openid.net/connect/ OpenID Connect (OIDC)>.
--
-- The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a
-- principal in a role\'s trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust
-- relationship between AWS and the OIDC provider.
--
-- When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following:
--
-- -   The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust
--
-- -   A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the
--     application or applications that are allowed to authenticate using
--     the OIDC provider
--
-- -   A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the
--     IdP uses
--
-- You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP that you want to use
-- to access AWS.
--
-- The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that
-- this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the
-- CreateOpenIDConnectProvider operation to highly privileged users.
