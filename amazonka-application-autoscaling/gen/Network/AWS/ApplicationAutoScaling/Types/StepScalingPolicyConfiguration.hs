    -- With scale-out policies, the intention is to continuously (but not
    -- excessively) scale out. After Application Auto Scaling successfully
    -- scales out using a step scaling policy, it starts to calculate the
    -- cooldown time. The scaling policy won\'t increase the desired capacity
    -- again unless either a larger scale out is triggered or the cooldown
    -- period ends. While the cooldown period is in effect, capacity added by
    -- the initiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the desired
    -- capacity for the next scale-out activity. For example, when an alarm
    -- triggers a step scaling policy to increase the capacity by 2, the
    -- scaling activity completes successfully, and a cooldown period starts.
    -- If the alarm triggers again during the cooldown period but at a more
    -- aggressive step adjustment of 3, the previous increase of 2 is
    -- considered part of the current capacity. Therefore, only 1 is added to
    -- the capacity.
    --
    -- With scale-in policies, the intention is to scale in conservatively to
    -- protect your application’s availability, so scale-in activities are
    -- blocked until the cooldown period has expired. However, if another alarm
    -- triggers a scale-out activity during the cooldown period after a
    -- scale-in activity, Application Auto Scaling scales out the target
    -- immediately. In this case, the cooldown period for the scale-in activity
    -- stops and doesn\'t complete.

    -- Application Auto Scaling provides a default value of 300 for the
