-- executions, otherwise false.
--
-- 'jobArn', 'jobSummary_jobArn' - The job ARN.
--
-- 'jobId', 'jobSummary_jobId' - The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

-- 'lastUpdatedAt', 'jobSummary_lastUpdatedAt' - The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job was last updated.
--
-- 'status', 'jobSummary_status' - The job summary status.
--
-- 'targetSelection', 'jobSummary_targetSelection' - Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will be
