    --     available. If there are not enough instances available, or if the

    --     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html Amazon EC2 service limits>
    --     then additional jobs aren\'t run until currently running jobs have
    --     completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit
    --     scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with @BEST_FIT@ then the Spot
    --     Fleet IAM Role must be specified.
    --
    -- [BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE]
    --     AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large
    --     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a
    --     preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If
    --     additional instances of the previously selected instance types
    --     aren\'t available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.
    --
    -- [SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED]
    --     AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large
    --     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a
    --     preference for instance types that are less likely to be
    --     interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot
    --     Instance compute resources.
    --
    -- With both @BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE@ and @SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED@
    -- strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above @maxvCpus@ to meet your

    -- by more than a single instance.
    allocationStrategy :: Prelude.Maybe CRAllocationStrategy,

    --
    -- This parameter isn\'t applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources,
    -- and shouldn\'t be specified.
    instanceRole :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance
    -- families to launch any instance type within those families (for example,
    -- @c5@ or @p3@), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such
    -- as @c5.8xlarge@). You can also choose @optimal@ to select instance types
    -- (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) on the fly that match the
    -- demand of your job queues.
    --
    -- This parameter isn\'t applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources,
    -- and shouldn\'t be specified.
    --
    -- When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you
    -- select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For
    -- example, you can\'t mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute
    -- environment.
    --
    -- Currently, @optimal@ uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4
    -- instance families. In Regions that don\'t have instance types from those
    -- instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance
    -- families are used.

    -- meet your capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch will never go
    -- above @maxvCpus@ by more than a single instance (e.g., no more than a
    -- single instance from among those specified in your compute environment).
    maxvCpus :: Prelude.Int,
    -- | The VPC subnets into which the compute resources are launched. These
    -- subnets must be within the same VPC. This parameter is required for jobs
    -- running on Fargate resources, where it can contain up to 16 subnets. For

--
-- [BEST_FIT (default)]
--     AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the
--     jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If
--     additional instances of the selected instance type aren\'t
--     available, AWS Batch will wait for the additional instances to be
--     available. If there are not enough instances available, or if the
--     user is hitting
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html Amazon EC2 service limits>
--     then additional jobs aren\'t run until currently running jobs have
--     completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit
--     scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with @BEST_FIT@ then the Spot
--     Fleet IAM Role must be specified.
--
-- [BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE]
--     AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large
--     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a
--     preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If
--     additional instances of the previously selected instance types
--     aren\'t available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.
--
-- [SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED]
--     AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large
--     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a
--     preference for instance types that are less likely to be
--     interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot
--     Instance compute resources.
--
-- With both @BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE@ and @SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED@
-- strategies, AWS Batch might need to go above @maxvCpus@ to meet your
-- capacity requirements. In this event, AWS Batch never exceeds @maxvCpus@
-- by more than a single instance.

-- demand of your job queues.
--
-- This parameter isn\'t applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources,

--
-- When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you
