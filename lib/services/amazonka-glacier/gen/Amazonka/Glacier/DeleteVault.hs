-- This operation deletes a vault. Amazon S3 Glacier will delete a vault
-- only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory and
-- there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory. If
-- either of these conditions is not satisfied, the vault deletion fails
-- (that is, the vault is not removed) and Amazon S3 Glacier returns an
-- error. You can use DescribeVault to return the number of archives in a
-- vault, and you can use
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-initiate-job-post.html Initiate a Job (POST jobs)>
-- to initiate a new inventory retrieval for a vault. The inventory
-- contains the archive IDs you use to delete archives using
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-delete.html Delete Archive (DELETE archive)>.
--
-- This operation is idempotent.
--
-- An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
-- However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don\'t have any
-- permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to
-- perform specific actions. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)>.
