## Description

Amazon Simple Notification Service

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that
enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications
can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to
interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more
information about this product see
<http://aws.amazon.com/sns/ http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/sns>. For detailed
information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls,
see the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/ Amazon SNS Developer Guide>.

We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your
preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that
automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing
your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses.
For a list of available SDKs, go to
<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sns)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
