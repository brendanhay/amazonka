-- Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS
-- service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and
-- subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at
-- <https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms> (\"Beta Terms\"). These Beta
-- Terms apply to your participation in this preview.
--
-- Modifies the parameters of a service.
--
-- For services using the rolling update (@ECS@) deployment controller, the
-- desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, task
-- placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be
-- updated.
--
-- For services using the blue\/green (@CODE_DEPLOY@) deployment
-- controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task
-- placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can
-- be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform
-- version, or task definition need to be updated, a new AWS CodeDeploy
-- deployment should be created. For more information, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html CreateDeployment>
-- in the /AWS CodeDeploy API Reference/.
--
-- For services using an external deployment controller, you can update
-- only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and
-- health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load
-- balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition
-- need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more
-- information, see CreateTaskSet.
--
-- You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task
-- definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is
-- running in and a new @desiredCount@ parameter.
--
-- If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create
-- a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The
-- service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent
-- parameters (in the service\'s deployment configuration) to determine the
-- deployment strategy.
--
-- If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the
-- existing task definition for your service (for example,
-- @my_image:latest@), you do not need to create a new revision of your
-- task definition. You can update the service using the
-- @forceNewDeployment@ option. The new tasks launched by the deployment
-- pull the current image\/tag combination from your repository when they
-- start.
--
-- You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a
-- deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service,
-- the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters,
-- @minimumHealthyPercent@ and @maximumPercent@, to determine the
-- deployment strategy.
--
-- -   If @minimumHealthyPercent@ is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore
--     @desiredCount@ temporarily during a deployment. For example, if
--     @desiredCount@ is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler
--     to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for
--     services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if
--     they are in the @RUNNING@ state. Tasks for services that use a load
--     balancer are considered healthy if they are in the @RUNNING@ state
--     and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy
--     by the load balancer.
--
-- -   The @maximumPercent@ parameter represents an upper limit on the
--     number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to
--     define the deployment batch size. For example, if @desiredCount@ is
--     four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping
--     the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required
--     to do this are available).
--
-- When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of
-- @docker stop@ is issued to the containers running in the task. This
-- results in a @SIGTERM@ and a 30-second timeout, after which @SIGKILL@ is
-- sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles
-- the @SIGTERM@ gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it,
-- no @SIGKILL@ is sent.
--
-- When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task
-- placement in your cluster with the following logic:
--
-- -   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can
--     support your service\'s task definition (for example, they have the
--     required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
--
-- -   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across
--     Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a
--     different placement strategy):
--
--     -   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of
--         running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as
--         the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service
--         task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances
--         in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
--
--     -   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an
--         optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps),
--         favoring container instances with the fewest number of running
--         tasks for this service.
--
-- When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain
-- balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the
-- following logic:
--
-- -   Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks
--     for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For
--     example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C
--     each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are
--     considered optimal for termination.
--
-- -   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability
--     Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances
--     with the largest number of running tasks for this service.
