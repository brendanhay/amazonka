-- | An object representing a container health check. Health check parameters
-- that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health
-- checks that exist in the container image (such as those specified in a
-- parent image or from the image\'s Dockerfile). This configuration maps
-- to the @HEALTHCHECK@ parameter of
-- <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/ docker run>.
--
-- The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health
-- checks specified in the task definition. Amazon ECS does not monitor
-- Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not
-- specified in the container definition. Health check parameters that are
-- specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks
-- that exist in the container image.
--
-- You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task
-- with the DescribeTasks API operation or when viewing the task details in
-- the console.
--
-- The following describes the possible @healthStatus@ values for a
-- container:
--
-- -   @HEALTHY@-The container health check has passed successfully.
--
-- -   @UNHEALTHY@-The container health check has failed.
--
-- -   @UNKNOWN@-The container health check is being evaluated or there\'s
--     no container health check defined.
--
-- The following describes the possible @healthStatus@ values for a task.
-- The container health check status of non-essential containers don\'t
-- have an effect on the health status of a task.
--
-- -   @HEALTHY@-All essential containers within the task have passed their
--     health checks.
--
-- -   @UNHEALTHY@-One or more essential containers have failed their
--     health check.
--
-- -   @UNKNOWN@-The essential containers within the task are still having
--     their health checks evaluated, there are only nonessential
--     containers with health checks defined, or there are no container
--     health checks defined.
--
-- If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will
-- continue its lifecycle regardless of its health status. For tasks that
-- are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task
-- will be stopped and the service scheduler will replace it.
--
-- The following are notes about container health check support:
--
-- -   Container health checks require version 1.17.0 or greater of the
--     Amazon ECS container agent. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html Updating the Amazon ECS container agent>.
--
-- -   Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you\'re
--     using platform version @1.1.0@ or greater. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html Fargate platform versions>.
--
-- -   Container health checks aren\'t supported for tasks that are part of
--     a service that\'s configured to use a Classic Load Balancer.
