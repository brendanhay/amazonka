-- | Contains an array of @Transition@ objects specifying how long in days
-- before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.
--
-- Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
-- a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the “retention” setting
-- must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days”
-- setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed
-- after a backup has been transitioned to cold.
--
-- Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage are
-- listed in the \"Lifecycle to cold storage\" section of the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html#features-by-resource Feature availability by resource>
-- table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.
