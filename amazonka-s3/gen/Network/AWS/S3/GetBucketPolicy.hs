-- Returns the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity
-- other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the
-- calling identity must have the @GetBucketPolicy@ permissions on the
-- specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner\'s account in order to
-- use this operation.
--
-- If you don\'t have @GetBucketPolicy@ permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
-- @403 Access Denied@ error. If you have the correct permissions, but
-- you\'re not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner\'s
-- account, Amazon S3 returns a @405 Method Not Allowed@ error.
--
-- As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a
-- bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly
-- denies the root user the ability to perform this action.
--
-- For more information about bucket policies, see
