-- Disables the integration of an AWS service (the service that is
-- specified by @ServicePrincipal@) with AWS Organizations. When you
-- disable integration, the specified service no longer can create a
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html service-linked role>
-- in /new/ accounts in your organization. This means the service can\'t
-- perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
-- organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts
-- until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.
--
-- We __/strongly recommend/__ that you don\'t use this command to disable
-- integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service.
-- Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified
-- service. This lets the trusted service perform any required
-- initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any
-- required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling
-- trusted access.
--
-- For information about how to disable trusted service access to your
-- organization using the trusted service, see the __Learn more__ link
-- under the __Supports Trusted Access__ column at
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html AWS services that you can use with AWS Organizations>.
-- on this page.
--
-- If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following
-- actions to occur:
--
-- -   The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the
--     accounts in your organization. This means that the service can\'t
--     perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your
--     organization. The service can still perform operations in older
--     accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS
--     Organizations.
--
-- -   The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in
--     the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted
--     by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes
--     any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management
--     account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.
--
-- -   Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or
--     resources related to the integration, while other services stop
--     accessing the organization but leave any historical data and
--     configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the
--     integration.
--
-- Using the other service\'s console or commands to disable the
-- integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up
-- any resources that are required only for the integration. How the
-- service cleans up its resources in the organization\'s accounts depends
-- on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the
-- other AWS service.
--
-- After you perform the @DisableAWSServiceAccess@ operation, the specified
-- service can no longer perform operations in your organization\'s
-- accounts
--
-- For more information about integrating other services with AWS
-- Organizations, including the list of services that work with
-- Organizations, see
-- <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services>
-- in the /AWS Organizations User Guide./
--
-- This operation can be called only from the organization\'s management
-- account.
