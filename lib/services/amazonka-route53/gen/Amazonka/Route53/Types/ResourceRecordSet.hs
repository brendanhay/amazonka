    -- | /Failover resource record sets only:/ To configure failover, you add the
    -- @Failover@ element to two resource record sets. For one resource record
    -- set, you specify @PRIMARY@ as the value for @Failover@; for the other
    -- resource record set, you specify @SECONDARY@. In addition, you include
    -- the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the health check that you want
    -- Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.
    --
    -- Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you
    -- have included the @HealthCheckId@ element in both resource record sets:
    --
    -- -   When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds
    --     to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource
    --     record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record
    --     set.
    --
    -- -   When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary
    --     resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
    --     with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.
    --
    -- -   When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
    --     responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary
    --     resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource
    --     record set.
    --
    -- -   If you omit the @HealthCheckId@ element for the secondary resource
    --     record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy,
    --     Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value
    --     from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of
    --     the health of the associated endpoint.
    --
    -- You can\'t create non-failover resource record sets that have the same
    -- values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as failover resource record
    -- sets.
    --
    -- For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the
    -- @EvaluateTargetHealth@ element and set the value to true.

    failover :: Prelude.Maybe ResourceRecordSetFailover,
    -- | /Geolocation resource record sets only:/ A complex type that lets you
    -- control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the
    -- geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries
    -- from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
    -- @192.0.2.111@, create a resource record set with a @Type@ of @A@ and a
    -- @ContinentCode@ of @AF@.
    --
    -- Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets
    -- in a private hosted zone is allowed, it\'s not supported.
    --
    -- If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic
    -- regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one
    -- for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest
    -- geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
    -- to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to
    -- a different resource.
    --
    -- You can\'t create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the
    -- same geographic location.
    --
    -- The value @*@ in the @CountryCode@ element matches all geographic
    -- locations that aren\'t specified in other geolocation resource record
    -- sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.
    --
    -- Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP
    -- addresses aren\'t mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
    -- geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route
    -- 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can\'t identify.
    -- We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value
    -- of @CountryCode@ is @*@. Two groups of queries are routed to the
    -- resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from
    -- locations for which you haven\'t created geolocation resource record
    -- sets and queries from IP addresses that aren\'t mapped to a location. If
    -- you don\'t create a @*@ resource record set, Route 53 returns a \"no
    -- answer\" response for queries from those locations.
    --
    -- You can\'t create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the
    -- same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as geolocation resource
    -- record sets.
    geoLocation :: Prelude.Maybe GeoLocation,
    -- | If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
    -- response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is
    -- healthy, include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the ID of the
    -- applicable health check.
    --
    -- Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on
    -- one of the following:
    --
    -- -   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified
    --     in the health check
    --
    -- -   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks
    --     (calculated health checks)
    --
    -- -   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch
    --     metric health checks)
    --
    -- Route 53 doesn\'t check the health of the endpoint that is specified in
    -- the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP
    -- address in the @Value@ element. When you add a @HealthCheckId@ element
    -- to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint
    -- that you specified in the health check.
    --
    -- For more information, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53
    -- Developer Guide/:

    --
    -- __When to Specify HealthCheckId__
    --
    -- Specifying a value for @HealthCheckId@ is useful only when Route 53 is
    -- choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS
    -- query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of
    -- a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
    -- following configurations:
    --
    -- -   __Non-alias resource record sets__: You\'re checking the health of a
    --     group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
    --     policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
    --     www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
    --     for all the resource record sets.
    --
    --     If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy,
    --     Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to
    --     DNS queries with.
    --
    --     If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
    --     Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that
    --     resource record set.
    --
    --     If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group
    --     is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the
    --     group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
    --
    -- -   __Alias resource record sets__: You specify the following settings:
    --
    --     -   You set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to true for an alias resource
    --         record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same
    --         routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted
    --         records named www.example.com with a type of A).
    --
    --     -   You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to
    --         a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
    --
    --     -   You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record
    --         set.
    --
    --     If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias
    --     resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record
    --     among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
    --
    --     If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
    --     to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
    --
    --     The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a /group/ of
    --     non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy,
    --     name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with
    --     all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource
    --     record sets.
    --
    -- __Geolocation Routing__
    --
    -- For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
    -- 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
    -- region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state
    -- in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America,
    -- and a resource record set that has @*@ for @CountryCode@ is @*@, which
    -- applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
    -- set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in
    -- the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the
    -- endpoint is healthy:
    --
    -- -   The United States
    --
    -- -   North America
    --
    -- -   The default resource record set
    --
    -- __Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name__
    --
    -- If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
    -- recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
    -- example, create a health check for each @HTTP@ server that is serving
    -- content for @www.example.com@. For the value of
    -- @FullyQualifiedDomainName@, specify the domain name of the server (such
    -- as @us-east-2-www.example.com@), not the name of the resource record
    -- sets (@www.example.com@).
    --
    -- Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
    --
    -- -   Create a health check that has the same value for
    --     @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ as the name of a resource record set.
    --
    -- -   Associate that health check with the resource record set.
    healthCheckId :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Text,
    -- | /Multivalue answer resource record sets only/: To route traffic
    -- approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers,
    -- create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify @true@
    -- for @MultiValueAnswer@. Note the following:
    --
    -- -   If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource
    --     record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
    --     corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.
    --
    -- -   If you don\'t associate a health check with a multivalue answer
    --     record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.
    --
    -- -   Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records;
    --     if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all
    --     DNS queries with all the healthy records.
    --
    -- -   If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to
    --     different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy
    --     records.
    --
    -- -   When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
    --     with up to eight unhealthy records.
    --
    -- -   If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a
    --     response, client software typically tries another of the IP
    --     addresses in the response.
    --
    -- You can\'t create multivalue answer alias records.
    multiValueAnswer :: Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Bool,
    -- | /Latency-based resource record sets only:/ The Amazon EC2 Region where
    -- you created the resource that this resource record set refers to. The
    -- resource typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such as an EC2
    -- instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or
    -- a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.
    --
    -- When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for
    -- which you have created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects
    -- the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the
    -- end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the
    -- value that is associated with the selected resource record set.
    --
    -- Note the following:
    --
    -- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per latency resource
    --     record set.
    --
    -- -   You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon
    --     EC2 Region.
    --
    -- -   You aren\'t required to create latency resource record sets for all
    --     Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region with the best
    --     latency from among the regions that you create latency resource
    --     record sets for.
    --
    -- -   You can\'t create non-latency resource record sets that have the
    --     same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as latency resource
    --     record sets.

    -- | The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the
    -- following:
    --
    -- -   If you\'re creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit

    --
    -- -   If you\'re associating this resource record set with a health check
    --     (if you\'re adding a @HealthCheckId@ element), we recommend that you
    --     specify a @TTL@ of 60 seconds or less so clients respond quickly to
    --     changes in health status.
    --
    -- -   All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource
    --     record sets must have the same value for @TTL@.
    --
    -- -   If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more
    --     weighted alias resource record sets for which the alias target is an
    --     ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify a @TTL@ of 60
    --     seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that
    --     have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL
    --     for load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you

    --
    -- To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic

    -- for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
    -- and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a
    -- resource\'s weight to the total. Note the following:
    --
    -- -   You must specify a value for the @Weight@ element for every weighted
    --     resource record set.
    --
    -- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per weighted resource
    --     record set.
    --
    -- -   You can\'t create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record
    --     sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as
    --     weighted resource record sets.
    --
    -- -   You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that
    --     have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.
    --
    -- -   For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you
    --     set @Weight@ to @0@ for a resource record set, Route 53 never
    --     responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource
    --     record set. However, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for all resource
    --     record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type,
    --     traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.
    --
    --     The effect of setting @Weight@ to @0@ is different when you

--
-- 'failover', 'resourceRecordSet_failover' - /Failover resource record sets only:/ To configure failover, you add the

-- set, you specify @PRIMARY@ as the value for @Failover@; for the other
-- resource record set, you specify @SECONDARY@. In addition, you include
-- the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the health check that you want
-- Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set.
--
-- Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you
-- have included the @HealthCheckId@ element in both resource record sets:
--
-- -   When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds
--     to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource
--     record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record
--     set.
--
-- -   When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary
--     resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
--     with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.
--
-- -   When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53
--     responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary
--     resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource
--     record set.
--
-- -   If you omit the @HealthCheckId@ element for the secondary resource
--     record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy,
--     Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value
--     from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of
--     the health of the associated endpoint.
--
-- You can\'t create non-failover resource record sets that have the same
-- values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as failover resource record
-- sets.
--
-- For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the

--
-- 'geoLocation', 'resourceRecordSet_geoLocation' - /Geolocation resource record sets only:/ A complex type that lets you
-- control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the
-- geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries
-- from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
-- @192.0.2.111@, create a resource record set with a @Type@ of @A@ and a
-- @ContinentCode@ of @AF@.
--
-- Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets
-- in a private hosted zone is allowed, it\'s not supported.
--
-- If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic
-- regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one
-- for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest
-- geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
-- to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to
-- a different resource.
--
-- You can\'t create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the
-- same geographic location.
--
-- The value @*@ in the @CountryCode@ element matches all geographic
-- locations that aren\'t specified in other geolocation resource record
-- sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.
--
-- Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP
-- addresses aren\'t mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
-- geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route
-- 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can\'t identify.
-- We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value
-- of @CountryCode@ is @*@. Two groups of queries are routed to the
-- resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from
-- locations for which you haven\'t created geolocation resource record
-- sets and queries from IP addresses that aren\'t mapped to a location. If
-- you don\'t create a @*@ resource record set, Route 53 returns a \"no
-- answer\" response for queries from those locations.
--
-- You can\'t create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the
-- same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as geolocation resource
-- record sets.
--
-- 'healthCheckId', 'resourceRecordSet_healthCheckId' - If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
-- response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is
-- healthy, include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the ID of the
-- applicable health check.
--
-- Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on
-- one of the following:
--
-- -   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified
--     in the health check
--
-- -   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks
--     (calculated health checks)
--
-- -   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch
--     metric health checks)
--
-- Route 53 doesn\'t check the health of the endpoint that is specified in
-- the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP
-- address in the @Value@ element. When you add a @HealthCheckId@ element
-- to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint
-- that you specified in the health check.
--
-- For more information, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53
-- Developer Guide/:

--
-- __When to Specify HealthCheckId__
--
-- Specifying a value for @HealthCheckId@ is useful only when Route 53 is
-- choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS
-- query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of
-- a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
-- following configurations:
--
-- -   __Non-alias resource record sets__: You\'re checking the health of a
--     group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
--     policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
--     www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
--     for all the resource record sets.
--
--     If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy,
--     Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to
--     DNS queries with.
--
--     If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
--     Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that
--     resource record set.
--
--     If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group
--     is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the
--     group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
--
-- -   __Alias resource record sets__: You specify the following settings:
--
--     -   You set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to true for an alias resource
--         record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same
--         routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted
--         records named www.example.com with a type of A).
--
--     -   You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to
--         a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
--
--     -   You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record
--         set.
--
--     If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias
--     resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record
--     among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
--
--     If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
--     to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
--
--     The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a /group/ of
--     non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy,
--     name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with
--     all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource
--     record sets.
--
-- __Geolocation Routing__
--
-- For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
-- 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
-- region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state
-- in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America,
-- and a resource record set that has @*@ for @CountryCode@ is @*@, which
-- applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
-- set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in
-- the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the
-- endpoint is healthy:
--
-- -   The United States
--
-- -   North America
--
-- -   The default resource record set
--
-- __Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name__
--
-- If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
-- recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
-- example, create a health check for each @HTTP@ server that is serving
-- content for @www.example.com@. For the value of
-- @FullyQualifiedDomainName@, specify the domain name of the server (such
-- as @us-east-2-www.example.com@), not the name of the resource record
-- sets (@www.example.com@).
--
-- Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
--
-- -   Create a health check that has the same value for
--     @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ as the name of a resource record set.
--
-- -   Associate that health check with the resource record set.
--
-- 'multiValueAnswer', 'resourceRecordSet_multiValueAnswer' - /Multivalue answer resource record sets only/: To route traffic
-- approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers,
-- create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify @true@
-- for @MultiValueAnswer@. Note the following:
--
-- -   If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource
--     record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
--     corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.
--
-- -   If you don\'t associate a health check with a multivalue answer
--     record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.
--
-- -   Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records;
--     if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all
--     DNS queries with all the healthy records.
--
-- -   If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to
--     different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy
--     records.
--
-- -   When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
--     with up to eight unhealthy records.
--
-- -   If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a
--     response, client software typically tries another of the IP
--     addresses in the response.
--
-- You can\'t create multivalue answer alias records.
--
-- 'region', 'resourceRecordSet_region' - /Latency-based resource record sets only:/ The Amazon EC2 Region where
-- you created the resource that this resource record set refers to. The
-- resource typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such as an EC2
-- instance or an ELB load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address or
-- a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.
--
-- When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for
-- which you have created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects
-- the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the
-- end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the
-- value that is associated with the selected resource record set.
--
-- Note the following:
--
-- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per latency resource
--     record set.
--
-- -   You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon
--     EC2 Region.
--
-- -   You aren\'t required to create latency resource record sets for all
--     Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region with the best
--     latency from among the regions that you create latency resource
--     record sets for.
--
-- -   You can\'t create non-latency resource record sets that have the
--     same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as latency resource
--     record sets.
--
-- 'resourceRecords', 'resourceRecordSet_resourceRecords' - Information about the resource records to act upon.
--
-- If you\'re creating an alias resource record set, omit
-- @ResourceRecords@.
--
-- 'setIdentifier', 'resourceRecordSet_setIdentifier' - /Resource record sets that have a routing policy other than simple:/ An
-- identifier that differentiates among multiple resource record sets that
-- have the same combination of name and type, such as multiple weighted
-- resource record sets named acme.example.com that have a type of A. In a
-- group of resource record sets that have the same name and type, the
-- value of @SetIdentifier@ must be unique for each resource record set.
--
-- For information about routing policies, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html Choosing a Routing Policy>
-- in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/.
--
-- 'ttl', 'resourceRecordSet_ttl' - The resource record cache time to live (TTL), in seconds. Note the
-- following:
--
-- -   If you\'re creating or updating an alias resource record set, omit
--     @TTL@. Amazon Route 53 uses the value of @TTL@ for the alias target.
--
-- -   If you\'re associating this resource record set with a health check
--     (if you\'re adding a @HealthCheckId@ element), we recommend that you
--     specify a @TTL@ of 60 seconds or less so clients respond quickly to
--     changes in health status.
--
-- -   All of the resource record sets in a group of weighted resource
--     record sets must have the same value for @TTL@.
--
-- -   If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or more
--     weighted alias resource record sets for which the alias target is an
--     ELB load balancer, we recommend that you specify a @TTL@ of 60
--     seconds for all of the non-alias weighted resource record sets that
--     have the same name and type. Values other than 60 seconds (the TTL
--     for load balancers) will change the effect of the values that you
--     specify for @Weight@.
--
-- 'trafficPolicyInstanceId', 'resourceRecordSet_trafficPolicyInstanceId' - When you create a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 automatically
-- creates a resource record set. @TrafficPolicyInstanceId@ is the ID of
-- the traffic policy instance that Route 53 created this resource record
-- set for.
--
-- To delete the resource record set that is associated with a traffic
-- policy instance, use @DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance@. Route 53 will delete
-- the resource record set automatically. If you delete the resource record
-- set by using @ChangeResourceRecordSets@, Route 53 doesn\'t automatically
-- delete the traffic policy instance, and you\'ll continue to be charged
-- for it even though it\'s no longer in use.
--
-- 'weight', 'resourceRecordSet_weight' - /Weighted resource record sets only:/ Among resource record sets that
-- have the same combination of DNS name and type, a value that determines
-- the proportion of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to using the
-- current resource record set. Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights
-- for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name
-- and type. Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a
-- resource\'s weight to the total. Note the following:
--
-- -   You must specify a value for the @Weight@ element for every weighted
--     resource record set.
--
-- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per weighted resource
--     record set.
--
-- -   You can\'t create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record
--     sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as
--     weighted resource record sets.
--
-- -   You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that
--     have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.
--
-- -   For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you
--     set @Weight@ to @0@ for a resource record set, Route 53 never
--     responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource
--     record set. However, if you set @Weight@ to @0@ for all resource
--     record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type,
--     traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability.
--
--     The effect of setting @Weight@ to @0@ is different when you
--     associate health checks with weighted resource record sets. For more
--     information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-configuring-options.html Options for Configuring Route 53 Active-Active and Active-Passive Failover>
--     in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/.
--
-- 'name', 'resourceRecordSet_name' - For @ChangeResourceRecordSets@ requests, the name of the record that you
-- want to create, update, or delete. For @ListResourceRecordSets@
-- responses, the name of a record in the specified hosted zone.
--
-- __ChangeResourceRecordSets Only__
--
-- Enter a fully qualified domain name, for example, @www.example.com@. You
-- can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot,
-- Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully
-- qualified. This means that Route 53 treats @www.example.com@ (without a
-- trailing dot) and @www.example.com.@ (with a trailing dot) as identical.
--
-- For information about how to specify characters other than @a-z@, @0-9@,
-- and @-@ (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DomainNameFormat.html DNS Domain Name Format>
-- in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/.
--
-- You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a
-- domain name, for example, @*.example.com@. Note the following:
--
-- -   The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can\'t specify
--     @*prod.example.com@ or @prod*.example.com@.
--
-- -   The * can\'t replace any of the middle labels, for example,
--     marketing.*.example.com.
--
-- -   If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a
--     domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a
--     wildcard.
--
--     You can\'t use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a
--     type of NS.
--
-- You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for
-- example, @*.example.com@. You can\'t use an * for one of the middle
-- labels, for example, @marketing.*.example.com@. In addition, the * must
-- replace the entire label; for example, you can\'t specify
-- @prod*.example.com@.
--
-- 'type'', 'resourceRecordSet_type' - The DNS record type. For information about different record types and
-- how data is encoded for them, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html Supported DNS Resource Record Types>
-- in the /Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide/.
--
-- Valid values for basic resource record sets: @A@ | @AAAA@ | @CAA@ |

-- resource record sets in the group.
--
-- Valid values for multivalue answer resource record sets: @A@ | @AAAA@ |
-- @MX@ | @NAPTR@ | @PTR@ | @SPF@ | @SRV@ | @TXT@
--
-- SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity of the sender of
-- email messages. However, we no longer recommend that you create resource
-- record sets for which the value of @Type@ is @SPF@. RFC 7208, /Sender
-- Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version
-- 1/, has been updated to say, \"...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined

-- | /Geolocation resource record sets only:/ A complex type that lets you
-- control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the
-- geographic origin of the query. For example, if you want all queries
-- from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of
-- @192.0.2.111@, create a resource record set with a @Type@ of @A@ and a
-- @ContinentCode@ of @AF@.
--
-- Although creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets
-- in a private hosted zone is allowed, it\'s not supported.
--
-- If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic
-- regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one
-- for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest
-- geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent
-- to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to
-- a different resource.
--
-- You can\'t create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the
-- same geographic location.
--
-- The value @*@ in the @CountryCode@ element matches all geographic
-- locations that aren\'t specified in other geolocation resource record
-- sets that have the same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements.
--
-- Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP
-- addresses aren\'t mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
-- geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route
-- 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can\'t identify.
-- We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value
-- of @CountryCode@ is @*@. Two groups of queries are routed to the
-- resource that you specify in this record: queries that come from
-- locations for which you haven\'t created geolocation resource record
-- sets and queries from IP addresses that aren\'t mapped to a location. If
-- you don\'t create a @*@ resource record set, Route 53 returns a \"no
-- answer\" response for queries from those locations.
--
-- You can\'t create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the
-- same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as geolocation resource
-- record sets.

-- | If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in
-- response to a DNS query only when the status of a health check is
-- healthy, include the @HealthCheckId@ element and specify the ID of the
-- applicable health check.
--
-- Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on
-- one of the following:
--
-- -   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified
--     in the health check
--
-- -   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks
--     (calculated health checks)
--
-- -   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch
--     metric health checks)
--
-- Route 53 doesn\'t check the health of the endpoint that is specified in
-- the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP
-- address in the @Value@ element. When you add a @HealthCheckId@ element
-- to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint
-- that you specified in the health check.
--
-- For more information, see the following topics in the /Amazon Route 53

--
-- __When to Specify HealthCheckId__
--
-- Specifying a value for @HealthCheckId@ is useful only when Route 53 is
-- choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS
-- query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of
-- a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
-- following configurations:
--
-- -   __Non-alias resource record sets__: You\'re checking the health of a
--     group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing
--     policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named
--     www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs
--     for all the resource record sets.
--
--     If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy,
--     Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to
--     DNS queries with.
--
--     If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
--     Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that
--     resource record set.
--
--     If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group
--     is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the
--     group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.
--
-- -   __Alias resource record sets__: You specify the following settings:
--
--     -   You set @EvaluateTargetHealth@ to true for an alias resource
--         record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same
--         routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted
--         records named www.example.com with a type of A).
--
--     -   You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to
--         a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.
--
--     -   You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record
--         set.
--
--     If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias
--     resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record
--     among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.
--
--     If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding
--     to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.
--
--     The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a /group/ of
--     non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy,
--     name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with
--     all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource
--     record sets.
--
-- __Geolocation Routing__
--
-- For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route
-- 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic
-- region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state
-- in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America,
-- and a resource record set that has @*@ for @CountryCode@ is @*@, which
-- applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record
-- set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in
-- the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the
-- endpoint is healthy:
--
-- -   The United States
--
-- -   North America
--
-- -   The default resource record set
--
-- __Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name__
--
-- If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we
-- recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For
-- example, create a health check for each @HTTP@ server that is serving
-- content for @www.example.com@. For the value of
-- @FullyQualifiedDomainName@, specify the domain name of the server (such
-- as @us-east-2-www.example.com@), not the name of the resource record
-- sets (@www.example.com@).
--
-- Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:
--
-- -   Create a health check that has the same value for
--     @FullyQualifiedDomainName@ as the name of a resource record set.
--
-- -   Associate that health check with the resource record set.

-- | /Multivalue answer resource record sets only/: To route traffic
-- approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers,
-- create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify @true@
-- for @MultiValueAnswer@. Note the following:
--
-- -   If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource
--     record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the
--     corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.
--
-- -   If you don\'t associate a health check with a multivalue answer
--     record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.
--
-- -   Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records;
--     if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all
--     DNS queries with all the healthy records.
--
-- -   If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to
--     different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy
--     records.
--
-- -   When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries
--     with up to eight unhealthy records.
--
-- -   If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a
--     response, client software typically tries another of the IP
--     addresses in the response.
--
-- You can\'t create multivalue answer alias records.

-- resource typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such as an EC2

-- a DNS domain name, depending on the record type.
--
-- When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for
-- which you have created latency resource record sets, Route 53 selects
-- the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the
-- end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the
-- value that is associated with the selected resource record set.
--
-- Note the following:
--
-- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per latency resource
--     record set.
--
-- -   You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon
--     EC2 Region.
--
-- -   You aren\'t required to create latency resource record sets for all
--     Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region with the best
--     latency from among the regions that you create latency resource
--     record sets for.
--
-- -   You can\'t create non-latency resource record sets that have the
--     same values for the @Name@ and @Type@ elements as latency resource
--     record sets.

--
-- -   You must specify a value for the @Weight@ element for every weighted
--     resource record set.
--
-- -   You can only specify one @ResourceRecord@ per weighted resource
