-- Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
-- files. Combine game server binaries into a zip file for use with Amazon
-- GameLift.
--
-- When setting up a new game build for Amazon GameLift, we recommend using
-- the CLI command
-- __<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html upload-build>__
-- . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build
-- files from a file directory to an Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location,
-- and (2) it creates a new build resource.
--
-- You can use the @CreateBuild@ operation in the following scenarios:
--
-- -   Create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3
--     location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To
--     use this option, you give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3
--     bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating
--     system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.
--
-- -   Upload your build files to a Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location. To
--     use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This
--     operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3
--     location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to
--     manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3
--     location. For more information, see
--     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html Uploading Objects>
--     in the /Amazon S3 Developer Guide/. After you upload build files to
--     the Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location, you can\'t update them.
--
-- If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique
-- build ID and places it in @INITIALIZED@ status. A build must be in
-- @READY@ status before you can create fleets with it.
