-- Validates an address to be used for 911 calls made with Amazon Chime
-- Voice Connectors. You can use validated addresses in a Presence
-- Information Data Format Location Object file that you include in SIP
-- requests. That helps ensure that addresses are routed to the appropriate
-- Public Safety Answering Point.
