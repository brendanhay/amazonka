--
-- Creates or updates a /composite alarm/. When you create a composite
-- alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into
-- account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The
-- composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule
-- are met.
--
-- The alarms specified in a composite alarm\'s rule expression can include
-- metric alarms and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a
-- composite alarm can include as many as 100 underlying alarms. Any single
-- alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as many as 150
-- composite alarms.
--
-- Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple
-- metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only
-- for the composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm
-- that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying
-- metric alarms are in ALARM state.
--
-- Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms
-- are notifying SNS topics.
--
-- It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where
-- composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B
-- also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can\'t delete
-- any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always
-- still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to
-- delete.
--
-- To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the
-- rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency
-- that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is
-- to change the @AlarmRule@ of one of the alarms to @false@.
--
-- Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
-- detects a cycle in the evaluation path.
--
-- When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
-- to @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
-- appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then
-- executed. For a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the
-- only time that the alarm can be in @INSUFFICIENT_DATA@ state.
--
-- When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
-- update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.
--
-- To use this operation, you must be signed on with the
-- @cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm@ permission that is scoped to @*@. You
-- can\'t create a composite alarms if your @cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm@
-- permission has a narrower scope.
--
-- If you are an IAM user, you must have @iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole@ to
-- create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.
