-- | Creates a value of 'ViewBilling' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'vbStart' - The beginning date and time for the time period for which you want a list of billing records. Specify the date in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'vbEnd' - The end date and time for the time period for which you want a list of billing records. Specify the date in Unix time format.
--
-- * 'vbMarker' - For an initial request for a list of billing records, omit this element. If the number of billing records that are associated with the current AWS account during the specified period is greater than the value that you specified for @MaxItems@ , you can use @Marker@ to return additional billing records. Get the value of @NextPageMarker@ from the previous response, and submit another request that includes the value of @NextPageMarker@ in the @Marker@ element.  Constraints: The marker must match the value of @NextPageMarker@ that was returned in the previous response.
--
-- * 'vbMaxItems' - The number of billing records to be returned. Default: 20
