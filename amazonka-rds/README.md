## Description

Amazon Relational Database Service

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that
makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in
the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an
industry-standard relational database and manages common database
administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
applications and businesses unique.

Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Aurora database server. This means the
code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing
databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS
automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software
that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your
database instance\'s compute resources and storage capacity to meet your
application\'s demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

This is an interface reference for Amazon RDS. It contains documentation
for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon
RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some
interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback
functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this
reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is
applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, go to
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces Available RDS Interfaces>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-rds)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
