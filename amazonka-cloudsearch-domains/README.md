## Version

`1.0.2`


## Description

You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search
domain and search those documents.

The endpoints for submitting @UploadDocuments@, @Search@, and @Suggest@
requests are domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use
the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service @DescribeDomains@ action.
The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the
Amazon CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search
endpoint.

For more information, see the
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide>.

Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudsearch-domains)
and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/what-is-cloudsearch.html).

The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),
which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.

Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).
