-- Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.
--
-- We don\'t charge hourly usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains, continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Each time you transition an instance from stopped to started, Amazon EC2 charges a full instance hour, even if transitions happen multiple times within a single hour.
--
-- You can\'t start or stop Spot instances, and you can\'t stop instance store-backed instances.
--
-- When you stop an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.
--
-- Stopping an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, and terminating instances, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html Instance Lifecycle> in the /Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide/.
